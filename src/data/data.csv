Health	Breastfeeding	How can I be sure that I have enough milk and that my milk is good enough?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-08-08.mp3	 Many women think they do not have enough milk. This is almost never true. Even mothers who do not have enough to eat can generally make enough milk for their babies. <br/> <br/> The amount of milk your breasts make (your milk supply) depends on how much the baby suckles. The more the baby suckles, the more milk you will make. If you skip a feeding and give a bottle instead of breast milk, your body will make less milk. <br/> <br/> Some days it may seem like the baby is always wanting to breastfeed. If you feed your baby whenever it is hungry, your milk supply will increase. In a few days the baby will probably seem satisfied again. Night feeding helps to build up a mother’s milk supply. Try not to believe anyone - even a health worker - who says that you do not have enough milk. <br/> <br/> Breasts do not have to feel full to make milk. The more babies a woman has breastfed, the less full her breasts will feel. Small breasts can make as much milk as large breasts. <br/> <br/> A baby is getting enough milk if: <br/> <ul><li> it is growing well, and seems happy and healthy.</li><li>it wets 6 or more times and dirties the diaper (nappy) about 1 to 3 times in a day and night. You can usually tell this after the baby is 5 days old, when the baby will start to pass urine and stool more regularly. A baby older than 2 weeks may not pass stool every day. If the baby is feeding well, wetting, and seems content, the stool will come.</li></ul> <li> it is growing well, and seems happy and healthy.</li>  it is growing well, and seems happy and healthy. <li>it wets 6 or more times and dirties the diaper (nappy) about 1 to 3 times in a day and night.

Health	Breastfeeding	How can I use breastfeeding for child-spacing?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-08-05.mp3	 Child-spacing means having babies at least 2 or 3 years apart. This allows a woman’s body to get strong before another pregnancy. For some women, breastfeeding helps them space their children.
Health	Breastfeeding	How long should I breastfeed my baby?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-08-02.mp3	 It is best to breastfeed for as long as possible, at least for one year. During the first 6 months, give your baby nothing but breast milk. <br/> <br/> If a nursing mother becomes pregnant, she can continue to breastfeed. Since breastfeeding and pregnancy take a lot from her own body, she should eat plenty of good foods.
Health	Breastfeeding	I work away from home - should I breastfeed my baby anyway?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-08-07.mp3	 Many women now work away from their homes. This can make it hard for a mother to give her baby nothing but breast milk during the first 6 months. But your baby could get sick without your milk. A working mother should not have to choose between her work and her child’s health. <br/> <br/> This is why working mothers need help. Some jobs allow a mother to bring her baby for a few months. This makes breastfeeding the easiest. If a mother has child care nearby, she might be able to breastfeed during the day, on her breaks. Some employers organize child-care centers so that parents can have their children close by. <br/> <br/> Here are some ways to make sure your baby gets only breast milk while you are at work: <br/> <ul><li> Keep your baby nearby for 6 months.</li><li>Or have someone bring the baby to you at feeding time.</li><li>When you are with your baby, feed it only from your breasts. If you sleep with the baby at night, it may feed more, and this will help you to make enough milk.</li><li>Some women ask a friend or a relative, like the baby's grandmother, to breastfeed their baby. If you want another woman to breastfeed your baby, she should be tested for HIV and have no risk of becoming infected while breastfeeding.</li><li>Another way a woman can give her baby breast milk during the day is if she can have time at work to remove the milk from her breasts. Then someone else can feed the baby for her. You can remove your milk by hand 2 or 3 times each day, then send or store the milk for someone to feed your baby.</li></ul> <li> Keep your baby nearby for 6 months.</li>  Keep your baby nearby for 6 months. <li>Or have someone bring the baby to you at feeding time.</li> Or have someone bring the baby to you at feeding time. <li>When you are with your baby, feed it only from your breasts.

If milk smells sour or strange, throw it out. Spoiled breast milk can make a baby very sick.<br/><br/><br/></p>
Health	Breastfeeding	What should I eat while breastfeeding?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-08-04.mp3	 Mothers need to eat well to recover from pregnancy, to care for their babies, and for all the other work they do. They need plenty of foods rich in protein, fats, and lots of fruits and vegetables. They also need to drink plenty of liquid - clean water, milk, herb teas, and fruit juices. But no matter how a woman eats and drinks, her body will make good breast milk. <br/> <br/> Eat and drink enough to satisfy hunger and thirst. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, drugs and unnecessary medicines. Clean water, fruit and vegetable juices, and milk and herb teas are better than coffee and sodas. <br/> <br/> Some people believe that new mothers should not eat certain foods. But if a mother does not get a balanced diet, it can lead tomalnutrition, weak blood (anemia), and other sickness. <br/> <br/> Sometimes women are given special foods during breastfeeding. These practices are good, especially if the foods are nutritious. Good foods help a woman’s body to grow healthy and strong more quickly after childbirth. <br/> <br/> A woman needs extra food if: <br/> <ul><li> she is breastfeeding 2 young children.</li><li>she is breastfeeding one child and is also pregnant.</li><li>her children are spaced closer than every 2 years.</li><li>she is sick or weak.</li></ul> <li> she is breastfeeding 2 young children.</li>  she is breastfeeding 2 young children. <li>she is breastfeeding one child and is also pregnant.</li> she is breastfeeding one child and is also pregnant.
Health	Breastfeeding	When should I stop breastfeeding?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-08-06.mp3	 A baby is ready for other feedings when: <br/> <ul><li> it is about six months old, or older.</li><li>it starts to grab food from the family or from the table.</li><li>it does not push food out with its tongue.</li></ul> <li> it is about six months old, or older.</li>  it is about six months old, or older. <li>it starts to grab food from the family or from the table.</li> it starts to grab food from the family or from the table. <li>it does not push food out with its tongue.</li> it does not push food out with its tongue. <p>Between 6 months and 1 year, give breast milk whenever the baby wants it. Do not give other foods before 4 months. Even if it is eating other foods, it still needs as much breast milk as before. Follow breastfeeding with other foods, 2 or 3 times a day at first. Begin with a soft, mild food, like cereal or porridge. Some women mix these with breast milk. You do not need expensive baby cereals.<br/><br/>If a baby does not seem happy or well-fed with breastfeeding, and it is between 4 and 6 months old, it may simply need to suckle more so that the mother’s breasts will make more milk. The mother should breastfeed the baby as often as the baby wants for about 5 days. If the baby is still unhappy, then she should try other foods: Mash all foods very fine at first until the baby can chew by itself. Use a cup or bowl and spoon to feed the baby.<br/><br/>Babies need to eat often - about 5 times a day. Each day, they should have some main food (porridge, maize, wheat, rice, millet, potato, cassava), mixed with a body building food (beans, finely ground nuts, eggs, cheese, meat or fish), brightly colored vegetables and fruits, and an energy-rich food (finely ground nuts, spoonful of oil, margarine or cooking fat). You do not have to cook 5 times a day. Some meals can be given as a cold snack.<br/><br/>Add new foods one at a time. By about 9 months to 1 year, a baby can eat most family foods if they are cut up and made easy to eat.<br/><br/>Even in the second year, breast milk continues to protect your child against infection and other health problems. If you can, keep breastfeeding until the child is at least 2 years old, even if you have another baby.

Health	Breastfeeding	Why can other than breastfeeding be harmful?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-08-03.mp3	 Companies that make artificial milk (infant formula) want mothers to feed their babies formula instead of breast milk so that the companies can make money. Using bottles or giving formula is often very unsafe. Millions of babies fed with bottles or formula have become malnourished or sick, or have died. <br/> <br/> Formula and other milks, such as tinned milk or the milk of animals, do not protect babies from disease. <br/> <br/> Formula and other milks can cause sickness and death. If the bottle, nipple, or water used to make the formula is not boiled long enough, the baby will swallow harmful germs and get diarrhea. <br/> <br/> When babies drink from the breast, they use their tongue to suckle, or ‘milk’ the breast. It is very different from what a baby’s mouth does when sucking on a bottle. By sucking on a bottle the baby may forget how to suckle well on the breast. And if the baby does not suckle on the breast enough, the mother’s milk supply will decrease, and the baby will stop feeding from the breast completely. <br/> <br/> Bottle-feeding costs a lot of money. For one baby, a family would need 40 kg of formula powder in the first year. Buying a day’s worth of formula and enough fuel to boil water can cost more than the family earns in a week - or even a month. Some parents try to make the milk or formula last longer by using less powder or more water. This makes a baby malnourished, grow more slowly and get sick more often. <br/> <br/>

Health	Cancer	How can I prevent cancer?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-14-03.mp3	 The direct causes of most cancers are not known.  <br/> <br/> Healthy living can prevent many cancers. This means eating nutritious food and avoiding things that may cause cancer. For example: <br/> <br/> Do not smoke or chew tobacco. <br/> <br/> Try to avoid harmful chemicals in your home or workplace, including foods grown or preserved with them. <br/> <br/> Breast lumps are very common in most women, especially soft, fluid-filled ones (called cysts). These usually change during a woman’s monthly cycle, and sometimes feel sore or painful when pressed. Few breast lumps are cancer. But since breast cancer is always a possibility, a woman should try to examine her breasts for lumps once a month. <br/> <br/> Cancer of the liver can be caused by hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis B and C can be prevented by having safer sex and not sharing needles. Also, there is a vaccine for hepatitis B. Babies can be vaccinated at birth. Adults can be vaccinated at any time. <br/> <br/> A new vaccine, called ‘HPV vaccine’, to protect youth against cervical cancer has been developed and is in use in many countries. It must be given to girls before they start having sexual intercourse. Ask a health worker if it is available where you live. <br/> <br/> IMPORTANT: Cancer can be cured if it is found and treated early.
Health	Cancer	What are harmful beliefs about cancer?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-14-02.mp3	 Women often do not see a health worker or doctor unless they are very sick. So women who get cancer are more likely to get very sick or die because the cancer is not found early enough. Also, women who get cancer are sometimes considered ‘cursed’ and may be shunned by their families or communities. This isolation is not only bad for the women who are sick, but also for the whole community, since it keeps everyone from knowing about how cancer makes people sick. <br/> <br/>
Health	Cancer	What is cancer?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-14-01.mp3	 Cancer is a serious sickness that can affect many different parts of the body. If it is treated early it is often curable, but if left too long it can cause death. Many people who get cancer die from it, especially those with little access to health care. <br/> <br/> All living things, like the human body, are made up of tiny cells that are too small to see without a microscope. Sometimes these cells change and grow in an abnormal way, causing growths (tumors). Some growths go away without treatment. But some growths get larger or spread and may cause health problems. Most growths do not become cancer, but some do. <br/> <br/> Cancer starts when some cells begin to grow out of control and take over parts of the body. When cancer is found early, it can often be removed by surgery, or treated with medicines or radiation, and the chance of it being cured may be good. Once cancer spreads, however, curing it is more difficult and eventually becomes impossible.
Health	Cleanliness	How are germs mostly spread?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-01-02.mp3	 Many illnesses are spread by germs that pass from one person to another. Here are some of the most common ways that germs are spread: <br/> <ul><li> by touching an infected person</li><li>through the air (for example, when someone coughs, germs in small drops of spit (saliva) can spread to other people or objects)</li><li>through clothes, cloths, or bed covers</li><li>through insect bites or animal bites</li><li>by eating contaminated food</li></ul> <li> by touching an infected person</li>  by touching an infected person <li>through the air (for example, when someone coughs, germs in small drops of spit (saliva) can spread to other people or objects)</li> through the air (for example, when someone coughs, germs in small drops of spit (saliva) can spread to other people or objects) <li>through clothes, cloths, or bed covers</li> through clothes, cloths, or bed covers
Health	Cleanliness	How can cleanliness in the community (sanitation) prevent sicknesses?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-01-04.mp3	 Many common health problems are best solved in the community. When the community works together to improve sanitation, everybody benefits. For example: <br/> <br/> <ul><li> by developing a source of clean water for drinking and cooking.</li><li>by getting rid of garbage in a safe way.</li><li>by draining standing water in washing areas, and in puddles, tires, and open containers.</li><li>by organizing your community to build latrines.</li></ul> <li> by developing a source of clean water for drinking and cooking.</li>  by developing a source of clean water for drinking and cooking. <li>by getting rid of garbage in a safe way.</li> by getting rid of garbage in a safe way.

They stay in place with a belt, pin, or underwear. The pads should be changed several times each day, and washed well with soap and water if they are to be used again. <br/> <br/> Some women put something inside the vagina that they buy or make from cotton, cloth, or a sponge. These are called tampons. If you use tampons, be sure to change them at least twice each day. Leaving one in longer may cause a serious infection. <br/> <br/> Wash your outside genitals with water each day to remove any blood that is left. Use a mild soap if you can.

To purify water using sunlight, fill clean, clear glass or plastic containers with water, and leave them outside from morning to late afternoon. Be sure to place the containers in an open space where they will be in the sun all day. (If drinking water is needed right away, putting the containers in the sun for 2 hours in the middle of the day should be enough for purification.) <br/> <br/> To avoid getting germs in the water, choose a spot away from children, dust, and animals. If you want the water to cool before using, bring the containers inside overnight. Water can be stored for a day or two in the same container. Sunlight purification works best in warm climates. <br/> <br/> <strong>Lemon juice</strong> Lemon juice <br/> Lemon juice sometimes kills cholera (and some other germs).

Health	Cleanliness	How does safe disposal of all garbage help prevent illness?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-01-06.mp3	 Germs can be spread by flies, cockroaches, rats and mice, which thrive in garbage such as food scraps and peelings from fruit and vegetables. <br/> <br/> Keeping the household and nearby areas clean and free of faeces, refuse and waste water can help prevent disease. Household waste water can be disposed of safely by making a soak pit or a channel to the kitchen garden or to the field. <br/> <br/> Chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides can be very dangerous if even small quantities get into the water supply or onto food, hands or feet. Clothes and containers used when handling chemicals should not be washed near a household water source.

Health	Cleanliness	How should I properly handle food for children?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-01-24.mp3	 Special care should be taken in preparing food for infants and small children. Their food should be freshly made and eaten immediately, not left standing. <br/> <br/> Breastmilk is the safest (and most nutritious) milk for infants and young children. Expressed breastmilk can be stored at room temperature for up to eight hours in a clean, covered container. If older children are given animal milk it should be freshly boiled or pasteurized (a special way of heating milk to destroy harmful bacteria). <br/> <br/> Raw or leftover cooked food can be dangerous. Raw food should be washed or cooked. Cooked food should be eaten without delay or thoroughly reheated before eating. <br/> <br/> All poultry and poultry products should be cooked the whole way through to prevent the spread of avian influenza (bird flu). <br/> <br/> Fruit and vegetables should be peeled or washed thoroughly with clean water, especially if they are to be eaten raw by young children. Fruits and vegetables are often treated with chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, which can be harmful.

Health	Disabilities	Can I have a satisfying sexual relationship?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-09.mp3	 Many people believe that women with disabilities cannot have, or should not have, sexual feelings. They are not expected to want to have close, loving relationships or to become parents. But women with disabilities do have a desire for closeness and sexual relations just like anyone else. <br/> <br/> If you were born with a disability, or it happened when you were very young, you may have a hard time believing you are sexually attractive. Talking with other women who have disabilities about their own fears, and how they overcame them, is often the best way to learn to feel differently about yourself. But remember to have patience. It takes time to change beliefs you have held for a long time. <br/> <br/> If you are a woman with a new disability, you may already be used to thinking of yourself as a sexual person. But you may not realize that you can continue to enjoy sex. You may think you are not sexually attractive any more and feel sad that sex may be different now. <br/> <br/> All women with disabilities can be helped by reading the same information about sexuality that women who are not disabled read. Try to talk about sexuality with them and with trusted teachers, health care workers, and other women with disabilities.
Health	Disabilities	How can I learn to value myself if I have a disability?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-04.mp3	 If a woman grows up with the support of her family, school and community to live the best life she can, her feelings of self-worth will be very high, whether or not she has a disability. But if a woman grows up feeling she is worth less than others because she has a disability, she has to work hard to learn to value herself. This process is never easy, but it can be done by taking small steps. <br/> <br/> The first step is to meet other people.  <br/> As other women get to know you, they will find out that women with and without disabilities are not really very different from each other. Each time you go out it will become easier to meet and talk with others. <br/> <br/> A second step is to start or join a group for women. <br/> Talking with others can help you begin to learn about your strengths and weaknesses. A group can provide a safe place for women to speak freely - if you all agree not to speak outside the group about anything that is said inside the group. <br/> <br/> You can also join or start a group for women with disabilities and share your thoughts and experiences about the special challenges that come from having a disability. You can all support each other during both happy and difficult times. <br/> <br/> You can support each other in learning how to become independent, too. All over the world women with disabilities are working as doctors, nurses, shop keepers, writers, teachers, farmers, and community organizers. With each other’s help, you can begin to prepare for the future, just as any woman would. <br/> <br/>
Health	Disabilities	How can I prevent contractures and keep my muscles strong?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-08.mp3	 To prevent contractures and keep your muscles strong, you need to find someone who can help you exercise your arms and legs every day. Try to make sure that every part of your body is moved. If you have had contractures for many years, it will be difficult to completely straighten your joints. But these exercises will prevent the contractures from getting worse and can make your joints a little less stiff and keep your muscles strong. <br/> <br/> <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
Health	Disabilities	How can I prevent skin problems?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-06.mp3	 Try to move at least every 2 hours. If you lie down all the time, have someone help you change position. <br/> <br/> Lie or sit on a soft surface that reduces pressure on bony areas. A cushion or sleeping pad that has hollowed-out areas around the bony parts will help. Or make a simple cushion or sleeping pad from a plastic bag filled with uncooked beans and rice. It must be refilled with new rice and beans once a month. <br/> <br/> Examine your whole body carefully every day. You can use a mirror to look at your back. If you notice a dark or red place, try to avoid any pressure on this area until your skin returns to normal. <br/> <br/> Try to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and foods rich in protein. <br/> <br/> During monthly bleeding, do not use cloth or tampons inside your vagina to catch the blood. They can press against your bones from inside your body and cause a sore in your vagina.
Health	Disabilities	Should I think about family planning?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-10.mp3	 Many girls with disabilities grow up with no information about sex or family planning. Yet most women with disabilities can become pregnant -  even those with no feeling in the lower body. So if you plan to have sex and do not want to become pregnant, you will need to use a family planning method. <br/> <br/> Here are some guidelines for deciding which family planning method might be best for you: <br/> <br/> If you have had a stroke, or cannot walk and you must sit or lie down all the time, do not use hormonal methods, such as birth control pills, injections, or implants. They can cause problems with blood clots. <br/> <br/> <br/> If you have no feeling or only a little feeling in your belly, do not use anintra-uterine device (IUD). If it is not put in correctly, or if there is a possibility you might get a sexually transmitted infection, it can cause an infection. Without feeling you may not be able to tell that you are infected. <br/> <br/> If you cannot use your hands well, it may be difficult for you to usebarrier methods, such as the diaphragm, the female condom, or foam. If you feel comfortable asking your partner, he may be able to put them in for you. <br/> <br/> If your disability changes over time, you may need to change your family planning method as your disability progresses.
Health	Disabilities	What are wrong ideas about disability?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-01.mp3	 About 1 out of every 10 women has a disability that affects daily living. She may have difficulties with walking, lifting, seeing, hearing or using her mind. <br/> <br/> In this chapter we use the word 'women with disabilities' rather than 'disabled women.' We do this to remind people that although a disability can prevent a woman from doing things, in other ways she is just like other women. She is a woman first. <br/> <br/> No matter what causes a woman's disability, she can be just as productive as a woman without a disability. She just needs the opportunity to develop her skills to their fullest.
Health	Disabilities	What causes disability?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-02.mp3	 In poor countries, many disabilities are caused by poverty, accidents, and by wars.  <br/> <br/> For example: <br/> <br/> If a mother does not get enough to eat when she is pregnant, her child may be born with a disability (birth defect). <br/> <br/> If a baby or young child does not get enough good food to eat she or he may become blind or mentally slow. <br/> <br/> Poor sanitation and crowded living conditions, together with poor food and a lack of basic health services and vaccinations, can lead to many disabilities. <br/> <br/> In today’s wars, more women and children are killed or disabled than are soldiers or other men.
Health	Disabilities	Why do women with disabilities often lack self-esteem?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-03.mp3	 Women with disabilities are often discriminated. They are rejected as suitable marriage partners or regarded as the ‘wrong’ image in the work place. Girls and women with disabilities are often not able to get an education, even when education is available. For example, even in special schools for children with disabilities, boys usually receive priority.  <br/> <br/> Women with disabilities are unlikely to receive training for any kind of work. They experience abuse - physically, emotionally, and sexually. Unlike all men and women without disabilities, they are seldom allowed to make decisions at home or in the community. 
Health	Disabilities	Why do women with disabilities often suffer from problems with the muscles?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-07.mp3	 Some women - for example, those who suffer from arthritis or strokes, or who are in bed because of AIDS or old age - have difficulty moving their arms and legs enough to keep their joints flexible. 
Health	Disabilities	Why do women with disabilities often suffer from skin problems?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-05.mp3	 If you sit or lie down all or most of the time, you can develop pressure sores. These sores start when the skin over the bony parts of the body is pressed against a chair or bed. The blood vessels get squeezed shut, so that not enough blood can get to the skin.
Health	Disabilities	Why should I take special care of my personal safety?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-11-11.mp3	 Since a woman with a disability may be less able to protect herself, she is more at risk for violent attack and abuse than a woman without a disability. But there are things a woman can do to defend herself. It may help to practice some of these things with a group of women with disabilities: <br/> <br/> If you are in a public place and someone tries to hurt or abuse you, shout as loudly as you can. <br/> <br/> Do something he might find disgusting, such as drooling spit (saliva), or trying to vomit, or acting as though you are ‘crazy’. <br/> <br/> Use your stick, crutches or wheelchair to hit or try to hurt the person.
Health	Growing Older	How can I eat well to stay healthy in my later years?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-09-04.mp3	 As a woman grows older she still needs nutritious food to keep her body strong and to fight disease. Her need for certain kinds of food also increases. Because her body makes less estrogen, it helps to eat foods high in plant estrogens, such as soy beans, tofu (bean curd), lentils, and other beans. Since her bones become less dense as she ages, it helps to eat foods high in calcium, a mineral that makes strong bones.
Health	Growing Older	How can I maintain happy sexual relations in my later years?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-09-09.mp3	 For some women, menopause means freedom from the sexual demands of marriage. Other women become more interested in sex because they no longer fear an unwanted pregnancy. All women, though, continue to need love and affection. There is no reason based on age alone that a woman cannot enjoy sex for as long as she lives. <br/> <br/> As a woman grows older, some of the changes in her body may affect her sexual relations: <br/> <ul><li> She may take longer to become excited during sex (this also happens to men).</li><li>Her vagina may be more dry, which can make sex uncomfortable, or make her get an infection of the vagina or the urine system more easily.

Health	Growing Older	How can I prevent illnesses in my later years?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-09-07.mp3	 Some people think that getting older means being sick much of the time. But this is not true. If a woman does not feel well, she may have an illness that can be treated, and that has nothing to do with age. She needs treatment as soon as possible.
Health	Growing Older	How does the end of monthly bleeding (menopause) affect my body and soul?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-09-01.mp3	 One of the main signs of growing older is that a woman’s monthly bleeding ends.

Health	Growing Older	How should I protect myself against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI) in my later years?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-09-10.mp3	 You can still become pregnant until your monthly bleeding has stopped for one full year. To prevent unwanted pregnancy, you should continue to use a family planning method during that time. <br/> <br/> If you are using a hormonal method of family planning (the pill, injections, or implants), stop using it around the age of 50 to see if you are still having monthly bleeding. Use another method of family planning until you have no monthly bleeding for one whole year (12 months).
Health	Growing Older	What can I do to feel better during menopause?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-09-02.mp3	 Menopause is a normal part of life. Although women sometimes feel uncomfortable during menopause, most can feel better by making changes in their daily habits and diet.  <br/> <br/> In the past, doctors used to recommend that women take medicines containing estrogen and progesterone to relieve the most severe symptoms of menopause. This is called “Hormone Replacement Therapy” (HRT). Unfortunately, HRT has now been shown to increase women’s risk of breast cancer, heart disease, blood clots, and stroke. So it is better for a woman to avoid using these medicines. <br/> <br/> If you are having signs that make you uncomfortable, try the following: <br/> <br/> Dress in clothes that you can take off easily when you begin to sweat. <br/> <br/> Avoid hot or spicy foods or drinks. They can cause hot flashes. <br/> <br/> Do not drink much coffee or tea. They contain caffeine, which can make you feel nervous and prevent you from sleeping. <br/> <br/> Get regular exercise. <br/> <br/> If you drink alcohol, drink only small amounts. Alcohol can increase bleeding and hot flashes. <br/> <br/> Stop smoking or chewing tobacco. It can cause unusual bleeding and make problems with weak bones much worse. <br/> <br/> Explain to your family that your feelings may change easily. It may also help to discuss how you feel with other women who are going through menopause.

Health	HIV and AIDS	How can I disinfect tools to prevent the spread of HIV?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-10-07.mp3	 Steps 1 and 2 should be done right after using your tools. Try not to let blood and mucus dry on them. Step 3 should be done right before you use the tools again. All the steps can be done together if you can store your tools so they will stay disinfected. <br/> <br/> 1. Soaking:  <br/> Soak your tools for 10 minutes. If possible, use a 0.5% solution of bleach (chlorine). Soaking your tools in bleach solution first will help protect you from infection when cleaning the tools. If you do not have bleach, soak your tools in water. <br/> <br/> 2. Washing:  <br/> Wash all tools with soapy water and a brush until each one looks very clean, and rinse them with clean water. Be careful not to cut yourself on sharp edges or points. If possible, use heavy gloves, or any gloves you may have. <br/> <br/> 3.

Enjoying safe sexual touch can help you stay healthier longer. <br/> <br/> Use protection (condoms) when you have sexual intercourse. This will protect you as well as your partner. <br/> <br/> Try joining or starting a group of people with HIV and AIDS. Some people with HIV and AIDS work together to educate the community, to provide home care to those who are sick with AIDS, and to support the rights of people with HIV and AIDS. <br/> <br/> Look after your spiritual and mental health. Your faith and traditions can bring you hope and strength. <br/> <br/> Think about the future.

Health	HIV and AIDS	How can I prevent HIV?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-10-06.mp3	 You can prevent the spread of HIV in these ways: <br/> <br/> If possible, have sex with only one partner who has sex only with you. <br/> <br/> Practice safer sex  -  sex that prevents semen, blood and vaginal fluids from getting into your vagina, anus, or mouth. Use condoms correctly whenever you have sex. <br/> <br/> Get tested for HIV and treated for STIs, and make sure your partners do too. <br/> <br/> Avoid piercing or cutting the skin with needles or other tools that have not been disinfected between uses. <br/> <br/> Avoid blood transfusions except in emergencies. <br/> <br/> Do not share razors.
Health	HIV and AIDS	How can I take good care of my health if I have HIV?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-10-10.mp3	 Look for an HIV care and treatment program as soon as you test positive for HIV. There is still no cure for HIV, but medicines can help people with HIV live longer and have fewer health problems. <br/> <br/> Take care of medical problems early. See a health worker regularly. When you get sick, make sure to get the treatment you need. Each infection can weaken your immune system more.  <br/> <br/> Eat nutritious food to keep your body strong. The same foods that are good to eat when you are healthy are good for you when you are sick. Buy nutritious food instead of spending money on vitamin injections. <br/> <br/> Avoid tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. <br/> <br/> Practice safer sex for your own health and your partner’s. <br/> <br/> Try to get enough rest and exercise. This will help your body stay strong to fight infection.
Health	HIV and AIDS	How does a HIV test work?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-10-08.mp3	 When HIV enters the body, the body starts to make antibodies right away to fight the virus. These antibodies usually show in the blood 2 to 4 weeks later. <br/> <br/> The HIV test looks for these antibodies in the blood. An HIV test is the only way to know if a person has been infected with HIV.  <br/> It is not a test for AIDS. <br/> <br/> Rapid HIV testing is available in many health centers and hospitals at low or no cost. You can usually get test results the same day. <br/> <br/> A positive HIV test means that you are infected with the virus and your body has made antibodies to HIV. Even if you feel completely well, you can spread the virus to others. <br/> <br/> A negative HIV test means 1 of 2 things: <br/> <ul><li> you are not infected with HIV, or</li><li>you were recently infected but your body has not yet made enough antibodies to HIV to test positive.</li></ul> <li> you are not infected with HIV, or</li>  you are not infected with HIV, or <li>you were recently infected but your body has not yet made enough antibodies to HIV to test positive.</li> you were recently infected but your body has not yet made enough antibodies to HIV to test positive. <p>If you have tested negative for HIV but think you might be infected, you should take the test again in about 6 weeks. Sometimes a positive test also needs to be repeated. A health worker can help you decide.<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT: A negative test only means that you do not have HIV when the test is taken.

Health	HIV and AIDS	What is AIDS?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-10-02.mp3	 HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a very small germ, called a virus, that you cannot see. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a disease that develops later, after a person has been infected with HIV, the AIDS virus. <br/> <br/> A person has AIDS when the immune system gets so weak that it can no longer fight off infections. Often the signs are staying sick with several common illnesses, such as diarrhea or flu. The signs of AIDS may be different in different people. A person with AIDS may also get infections that are rare in people without HIV, like certain cancers or brain infections.
Health	HIV and AIDS	What is HIV?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-10-01.mp3	 HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a very small germ, called a virus, that you cannot see. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a disease that develops later, after a person has been infected with HIV, the AIDS virus. <br/> <br/> When a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus attacks the immune system, the part of your body that fights off infection. HIV slowly kills the cells of the immune system until the body can no longer defend itself against other infections. Most people who are infected do not get sick from their HIV for 5 to 10 years. But eventually the immune system cannot fight off common infections. Because HIV takes years to make someone sick, most people with HIV feel healthy and do not know they have it.  <br/> <br/>
Health	HIV and AIDS	Why is is even more important for me as a woman to protect me from HIV and AIDS?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-10-05.mp3	 HIV and AIDS are different for women because: <br/> <br/> Women get infected with HIV more easily than men do because during sex, she is the ‘receiver’. This means a man’s semen stays in the woman’s vagina for a long time. And if there is HIV in the semen, there is more chance for it to pass into a woman’s blood through her vagina or cervix, especially if there are any cuts, sores, or STIs. <br/> <br/> Women are often infected at a younger age than men. This is because young women and girls are less able to refuse unwanted or unsafe sex and are often married young to older men who have had more chances to be infected. <br/> <br/> Women often live with untreated STIs. These make it easier to become infected with HIV. <br/> <br/> Women get more blood transfusions than men because of problems during childbirth. <br/> <br/> Poor nutrition and weakness from childbearing too often make women less able to fight disease. <br/> <br/> Women are blamed unfairly for the spread of AIDS, even though many men are unwilling to wear condoms or limit their number of sex partners. <br/> <br/> A pregnant woman infected with HIV can pass it to her baby.
Health	Infertility	How can I prevent infertility?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-12-04.mp3	 Try not to worry if you do not get pregnant right away: <br/> Many couples get pregnant within a year if they continue to have sex during the woman's fertile days. <br/> <br/> Avoid contaminated air, food, or water caused by dangerous pesticides or toxic chemicals used in factories and farms: Pesticides and other harmful chemicals can hurt a man's sperm while he works and if the woman washes his clothes, the harmful chemicals are passed on to her. <br/> <br/> Avoid smoking or chewing tobacco, or drinking alcohol or coffee:  <br/> Women who smoke or chew tobacco, or who drink a lot of alcohol or coffee may take longer to become pregnant or have more miscarriages. Men who smoke or drink a lot of alcohol or coffee make fewer sperm, and these are often damaged or weak. <br/> <br/> Avoid high temperatures:  <br/> A man’s sperm need to stay cool. That is why the testicles hang in the scrotum outside a man’s body. When the testicles get too warm they can stop making healthy sperm. For example, this can happen if a man wears tight clothes that press his testicles up inside his body, or if he takes a hot bath, or works near hot things such as boilers, furnaces, or the hot engine of a long-distance truck -  especially if he drives for many hours without a break. Once the testicles become cool, they start making healthy sperm again. <br/> <br/> Do not use any medicines:   <br/> Some medicines can hurt fertility. The best choice is for you and your partner not to use any medicines while you are trying to become pregnant. If you must use medicines because of illness, talk to a health worker and tell her you are trying to get pregnant. <br/> <br/> Try to have sex during your fertile time:  <br/> Although a man makes millions of sperm every day, a healthy woman releases only one egg a month. This is called her fertile time - the only time during the month when she can get pregnant. For most women their fertile time starts about 10 days after the first day of the monthly bleeding and lasts about 6 days. The body has several signs that tell you when you are in a fertile time. The easiest signs to check are the changes in the mucus in your vagina. <br/> <br/> When you have sex: <br/> The best positions for getting the sperm close to the opening of your womb are: <ul><li> to lie on your back with the man on top.</li><li>to lie on your side. <br/>Then, after having sex, lie flat on your back for about 20 minutes.

If either of you has an STI, both of you must be treated. Be sure to finish all the medicines you are given.<br/><br/>Eat good, healthy food: <br/>If you do not have regular monthly bleeding and you are very thin or very fat, try to gain or lose weight.<br/><br/>Avoid smoking or chewing tobacco, taking drugs or drinking alcohol.<br/><br/>Avoid caffeine in drinks like coffee, black tea, and cola drinks.<br/><br/>Get plenty of rest and regular exercise.<br/><br/>Try to see a health worker if you are not pregnant after one year: <br/>There are some simple tests that do not cost much that may be able to tell you what the problem is. For example, the health worker may look at your partner’s sperm under a microscope to see if they are healthy. She may give you a pelvic exam to check your vagina, womb, and tubes for infection or growths. Or she may teach you to tell if your ovaries are releasing an egg by taking your temperature every morning. It is important to remember that these tests only tell you what the problem is - they will not solve it.

Health	Infertility	What can cause infertility in a man?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-12-02.mp3	 The main causes of infertility in a man are: <br/> <br/> 1. He does not produce enough sperm.

Scarring in the tube can prevent the egg from moving through the tube, or the sperm from swimming to the egg. Scarring in the womb can prevent the fertilized egg from attaching to the wall of the womb. Sometimes a woman gets scarring but does not know it because she does not feel ill. But years later she learns she is infertile. <br/> <br/> Scarring can be caused by: <br/> <ul><li> an infection from an untreated STI that goes up into the womb or tubes (pelvic inflammatory disease or PID)</li><li>unsafe abortion or problems in childbirth that caused damage or infection in the womb</li><li>unclean conditions when an IUD is put in that caused an infection</li><li>problems from an operation of the vagina, womb, tubes, or ovaries</li></ul> <li> an infection from an untreated STI that goes up into the womb or tubes (pelvic inflammatory disease or PID)</li>  an infection from an untreated STI that goes up into the womb or tubes (pelvic inflammatory disease or PID) <li>unsafe abortion or problems in childbirth that caused damage or infection in the womb</li> unsafe abortion or problems in childbirth that caused damage or infection in the womb <li>unclean conditions when an IUD is put in that caused an infection</li> unclean conditions when an IUD is put in that caused an infection <li>problems from an operation of the vagina, womb, tubes, or ovaries</li> problems from an operation of the vagina, womb, tubes, or ovaries <p><br/><strong>She does not produce an egg (no ovulation).</strong> This can be because the body does not make enough of the needed hormones at the right time.

Health	Malaria	How can I prevent malaria during pregnancy?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-17-03.mp3	 Malaria is very dangerous for pregnant women. As preventive treatment, pregnant women in malarial areas, especially those in their first pregnancy, who can be asymptomatic (without symptoms), should take antimalarial tablets in the second and third trimesters, as recommended by a trained health worker. The health worker will know which antimalarial tablets are best to take. <br/> It is also very important that pregnant women sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito nets.
Health	Malaria	How can I prevent malaria in general?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-17-04.mp3	 Malaria is transmitted through the bites of some mosquitoes. Sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net is the best way to prevent mosquito bites. <br/> <br/> All members of the community should be protected against mosquito bites, particularly young children and pregnant women. Protection is needed after sunset and before sunrise, when malaria mosquitoes bite. <br/> <br/> Long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets last for at least three years and do not require re-treatment with insecticide. These nets are distributed by malaria control programmes and can be obtained through health facilities or during child health days or integrated campaigns. Most mosquito nets are distributed free of charge, especially to pregnant women and young children. They can also be purchased in the marketplace or through social marketing programmes, mainly in urban areas. In the few cases where untreated nets might still be in use, trained health workers can advise on safe insecticides and re-treatment. <br/> <br/> Insecticide-treated mosquito nets should be used throughout the year, even when there are fewer mosquitoes, such as during the dry season. <br/> <br/> Some countries operate programmes to spray the walls of houses with long-lasting insecticides to kill resting mosquitoes. Communities should cooperate with spray teams to ensure that all houses are sprayed. <br/> <br/> In addition to using insecticide-treated mosquito nets, or if mosquito nets are not available or used, other actions can help, but they are not nearly as effective as using mosquito nets: <br/> <ul><li> putting screens on doors and windows; these are mostly used in urban settings and are not very effective in traditional rural housing</li><li>using mosquito coils; these are used to repel but not kill mosquitoes – they have no lasting effect</li><li>wearing clothing that covers the arms and legs (long sleeves and long trousers or skirts); these can help reduce mosquito bites if worn when malaria mosquitoes are most active – from dusk until dawn.</li></ul> <li> putting screens on doors and windows; these are mostly used in urban settings and are not very effective in traditional rural housing</li>  putting screens on doors and windows; these are mostly used in urban settings and are not very effective in traditional rural housing <li>using mosquito coils; these are used to repel but not kill mosquitoes – they have no lasting effect</li>
Health	Malaria	What is malaria?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-17-01.mp3	 Malaria is a serious disease spread through mosquito bites. Malaria is found in many regions of the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is a leading cause of death, illness, and poor growth and development among young children. It is estimated that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds in this area.
Health	Malaria	Why is malaria especially dangerous for pregnant women?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-17-02.mp3	 Pregnant women are more likely to suffer from malaria than other women. The disease is more dangerous during pregnancy, especially during the first pregnancy. This is due to changes in a woman's body that lower her previous level of resistance to malaria. Malaria can cause severe anaemia ('thin blood'), miscarriage, premature birth or stillbirth. <br/> <br/> Babies born to mothers who have had malaria during pregnancy are often underweight. This makes them more vulnerable to infection or death during their first year.
Health	Mental Health	How can changes in my life and community damage my mental health?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-15-04.mp3	 In many parts of the world, communities are being forced to change rapidly - because of changes in the economy or because of political conflict. Many of these changes require families and communities to alter their entire way of life. Here are two example stories:  <br/> <br/> „My name is Edhina. When the war started, soldiers came and forced the men in our village to fight. Some of the women were raped. We fled into the mountains, but it was hard to find food. Now we live as refugees in a camp just across the border. We usually have enough to eat, but many people are sick. The camp is crowded with strangers. Every day I wonder - will I ever see my home again?“ <br/> <br/> „My name is Jurema. Every year our land produced less. We had to borrow money to buy seeds, and even tried buying fertilizer, but we could never grow enough to pay back the bank. We were finally forced to leave our land. Now we live in a shack at the edge of the city. Every morning when I wake up, I listen for the birds that had always greeted the morning. But then I remember - there are no birds here. There is only another day of scrubbing other people's floors.“

In a helping relationship, two or more people make a commitment to get to know and understand each other. This can happen in any relationship - between friends, family members, or women who work together, or in a group that already meets for another purpose. Or a new group may form because the people share a common problem. These are often called ‘support groups’.
Health	Mental Health	How can I prevent mental health problems by strengthening my personal coping skills?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-15-11.mp3	 Women do not often take time out of their busy day to do something for themselves. But every woman needs to put her problems aside sometimes and do what she likes. Simple things that you may not do very often - like spending time alone, or shopping, gardening, or cooking with a friend - can all be helpful. <br/> <br/> Activities to let your feelings out: If you are angry, do some hard physical work. Making up poems, songs, and stories can be helpful when you have trouble saying things to others. Or you can draw your feelings without using words - you do not have to be an artist. <br/> <br/> Creating pleasing surroundings: Try to fix your living space so that it feels right to you. No matter how small it is, you will feel more order and control when it is arranged the way you like. Try to have as much light and fresh air as possible. <br/> Try to have some beauty around you. This could mean putting some flowers in the room, playing music, or going where there is a nice view.

Health	Mental Health	How can stress in daily life damage my mental health?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-01-15-02.mp3	 Daily activities and events often put pressure on a woman, causing tension in her body and mind (stress). Stress can come from physical problems, like illness or overwork. Or it can come from emotional events, like conflict in the family or being blamed for problems that a woman has no control over. Even events that often bring pleasure - like a new baby or getting a job - can be stressful because they create changes in a woman’s life. <br/> <br/> Most women have many kinds of stress pressuring them from all sides:  <br/> <ul><li> caring for children</li><li>meeting husband‘s needs</li><li>getting water, fuel</li><li>cleaning</li><li>caring for the sick</li><li>too little money</li><li>farming or working</li><li>too little food</li></ul> <li> caring for children</li>  caring for children <li>meeting husband‘s needs</li> meeting husband‘s needs <li>getting water, fuel</li> getting water, fuel <li>cleaning</li> cleaning <li>caring for the sick</li> caring for the sick <li>too little money</li> too little money <li>farming or working</li> farming or working <li>too little food</li> too little food <p>It is easy not to notice the stress in daily life because it is always there. But it takes a lot of a woman‘s energy to cope with this kind of stress. <br/><br/>When a woman faces a lot of stress every day and for a long time, she may begin to feel overwhelmed and unable to cope. The problem may be made worse if she has been taught to take care of others first and neglects her own needs. With little time to rest or to enjoy things that could help reduce her stress, she may ignore signs of illness or overwork. And as a woman, she may have little power to change her situation. <br/><br/>Often a woman is made to feel that she is weak or ill. But the real problem may be something that is not fair or not right in life. To have better mental health, women need to have more control and power over their lives. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p> It is easy not to notice the stress in daily life because it is always there.

Family	Abortion	How can I get access to safe abortion?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-02-05.mp3	 When a woman is faced with an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to get a safe and legal abortion. But laws about abortion differ from one country to another: <br/> <br/> Legal abortion: If abortion is legal a woman can walk into a health center or hospital, pay a fee, and have a safe abortion. In countries where this happens, almost no women get sick or die from complications of abortion. <br/> <br/> Legal abortion in some cases: In some countries an abortion is only legal for certain reasons, such as: <ul><li> if a woman becomes pregnant from rape or incest (sex with a close family member).</li><li>if a doctor says pregnancy would be a danger to a woman’s health.</li></ul> <li> if a woman becomes pregnant from rape or incest (sex with a close family member).</li>  if a woman becomes pregnant from rape or incest (sex with a close family member). <li>if a doctor says pregnancy would be a danger to a woman’s health.</li> if a doctor says pregnancy would be a danger to a woman’s health. <p>But abortion is often difficult to get, even for those reasons. Doctors and health workers may not be sure what the law really says. They may be unwilling to do abortions openly, or they may charge a lot of money. Women may not know if abortion is legal or available in their country. <br/><br/>Legal or not, it can be hard to get a safe abortion because it is too costly, too far away, or because there are confusing rules, or papers to fill out. <br/>These reasons often make it especially difficult for women who are poor, or who are not familiar with the medical system, to get safe abortions. <br/>Unfortunately, in many places, the only women who can easily get a safe abortion are women who can afford to pay a private doctor. <br/><br/>Illegal abortion:  If abortion is not legal, both the women who get abortions and those who perform them can be arrested. In most places this does not happen. But where abortion is against the law, more women die from unsafe abortion and unsafe pregnancies. Money that could be spent on women’s health services is spent instead on treating complications of unsafe abortion.<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Never assume abortion is illegal. Try to find out about the laws in your own country. It may be easier to work around the laws than to try and change them. Even if abortion is illegal, there may be people providing safe abortions. Finding a safe abortion may mean the difference between staying alive and dying. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p> But abortion is often difficult to get, even for those reasons.

Family	Abortion	How to prevent death from unsafe abortion?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-02-04.mp3	 Women have always tried to find ways to end pregnancy when they are desperate. Stay away from the following methods. They are very dangerous: <br/> <br/> Do not put sharp objects like sticks, wire, or plastic tubing into the vagina and womb. These can tear the womb and cause dangerous bleeding and infection. <br/> <br/> Do not put herbs or plants in the vagina or womb. These can burn or irritate badly, causing damage, infection, and bleeding. <br/> <br/> Do not put substances such as bleach, lye, ashes, soap, or kerosene in the vagina or womb. Also, do not drink them. <br/> <br/> Do not take medicines or traditional remedies in large amounts to cause abortion (either by mouth or in the vagina). For example, taking too much of the medicines for malaria (chloroquine) or to stop bleeding after childbirth (ergometrine, oxytocin) can kill you before they cause abortion. <br/> <br/> Do not hit your abdomen or throw yourself down stairs. This can cause injury and bleeding inside your body, but may not cause abortion. <br/> <br/> <strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> IMPORTANT:   Never put anything inside the womb yourself or allow an untrained person to do so. This can kill you. <br/>

Family	Abortion	Which methods of abortion are safe?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-02-07.mp3	 A pregnancy can be removed from the womb by a trained health worker in the following ways: <br/> <br/> <strong>Abortion by suction (vacuum aspiration, MVA)</strong> Abortion by suction (vacuum aspiration, MVA) <br/> The pregnancy is removed by suction using a special tube (cannula) that is put into the womb through the vagina and cervix. This can be done without putting the woman to sleep, though sometimes medicine is injected into the cervix to help with the pain. When vacuum aspiration is done by hand (manual vacuum aspiration or MVA), the pregnancy is removed using a special syringe. Otherwise, a small electric machine is used. MVA is simple and safe, and takes only about 5 to 10 minutes. It is usually done in a clinic or health post, or doctor’s office. This kind of abortion is safe to do during the first 12 weeks (3 months) of pregnancy. <br/> <br/> <strong>Abortion by scraping (dilation and curettage, or D and C)</strong> Abortion by scraping (dilation and curettage, or D and C) <br/> The pregnancy is scraped out with a curette, a small spoonshaped instrument that is made especially to go into the womb. A curette is larger than a cannula and because it is sharp, the cervix must first be stretched open. This stretching can cause some pain. The D and C takes more time to do (about 15 to 20 minutes), is more painful, and costs more than vacuum aspiration. It is usually done in an operating room, and the woman is often given medicine to make her sleep. <br/> <br/> <strong>Abortion by medicine (medical abortion)</strong> Abortion by medicine (medical abortion)

Family	Advice for Girls	Am I less important than a boy?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-03.mp3	 The way a woman sees herself forms as she grows. It is important that a girl learn to feel good about herself when she is young, so that she will be able to develop fully and help make her community a better place. A girl is much more likely to learn this when her family and community show her that they value her. <br/> <br/> In many places girls are raised to believe they are less important than boys. They are taught to feel shame about their bodies and about being female, and they learn to accept less education, less food, more abuse, and more work than their brothers. This not only hurts their health directly, but it makes them feel bad about themselves and less able to make the right decisions for a healthier life in the future. When girls are raised in this way, it shows that their communities do not value them as much as boys. <br/> <br/> But if a girl’s community recognizes the value of each person - whether the person is male or female - she will grow up feeling she can make a better life for herself and for her family and neighbors.
Family	Advice for Girls	How can I avoid being sold into marriage or being sent away to work?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-17.mp3	 Sometimes a poor family will give a young daughter to an older man to pay a family debt.

They think they are going to work in factories, or as maids, but they are often forced to have sex for money.
Family	Advice for Girls	How can I better talk to my parents?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-19.mp3	 Talking with your mother or father can be hard sometimes. Your parents may want you to live by tradition, but you feel that times are changing. You may feel that your parents do not listen or try to understand you. Or you may be afraid they will get angry. <br/> <br/> Your family can love you without agreeing with everything you say. They may get angry because they care  -  not because they do not like you.

Family	Advice for Girls	How can I have a good future?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-04.mp3	 Try to plan your future.  <br/> <br/> The first thing you can do to plan for your future is to set goals. A goal is something you would like to happen.  <br/> <br/> For most girls this is not easy. Many feel their lives are controlled by their families or the traditions of their communities. But you can start to help yourself by knowing what you want. <br/> <br/> Next, try to talk to a woman or man who works at something you would like to do. It could be someone you admire, or a leader in your community. Ask if you can spend time with that person to learn more about their work. <br/> <br/> Sometimes girls feel frustrated because their dreams and hopes for their future may conflict with the beliefs in their community and family about what a woman should do. It is important to explain your dreams and hopes carefully to adults and to listen to their concerns also.
Family	Advice for Girls	How can I have a relationship with no sex?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-11.mp3	 Building a loving relationship takes time, caring, respect, and trust from both sides. Sex is not the only way of showing someone that you care. Having sex does not mean that you will fall in love. <br/> <br/> You can spend personal time together without having sex. By talking and sharing experiences you can learn something more important about each other - how you view life, decisions you would make together, what kind of partner and parent you would each make, and how you feel about each other’s plans for life. Touching each other (without sexual intercourse) can be satisfying by itself, and is not dangerous as long as it does not lead you to lose control and to have sex when you are not ready. <br/> <br/> Talk to your boyfriend. If you are sure he is right for you, but you are not sure you want to have sex, talk about ways to wait. You may find that he is not ready for sex, either. If you respect each other, you will be able to decide together.
Family	Advice for Girls	How can I prevent pressured or forced sex?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-14.mp3	 If he wants to have sex and you do not, you can tell him you are flattered by his desire for you but that you are not ready. If you are afraid of being alone with the person, bring someone with you, or ask someone else to talk with him. <br/> <br/> Say "NO" loudly if you are pushed to have sex. Keep saying "NO" if you have to. Also say no with your body. If you say "NO," but give in with your body, he will think that you really mean "yes." <br/> <br/> Move away if you are touched in any way that you do not like. Your feelings are warning you that something worse may happen. Make a lot of noise and be ready to run if you have to. <br/> <br/> Do not drink alcohol or take drugs. Alcohol and drugs make you less able to use your judgment and control what happens to you. <br/> <br/> Go out in groups. In many places, young couples court or date in groups. You can still get to know a boy, but you are less likely to be pushed into having sex because you will not be alone. <br/> <br/> Go only to safe places where others can see you.
Family	Advice for Girls	How can I protect myself if I am ready for sex?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-12.mp3	 When you decide you are ready for a sexual relationship, you must protect yourself against pregnancy and disease. There are many ways to make sex safer. This means you have to plan before you have sex. <br/> <br/> Talk to your boyfriend before you have sex. Let him know how important it is to protect yourself. If you find it hard to discuss, perhaps you can first pretend you are talking about another couple. If he really cares about you, he will want to protect you. If he is pushing for sex, he may care only about himself. <br/> <br/> Many communities have people who are trained to provide condoms and other family planning methods. Talk to them or ask a health worker where to get a method of protection. If you feel embarrassed to ask, find someone you trust to help you. Some family planning clinics have special services for teenagers and may have trained teenagers as peer counselors who can give you information. <br/> <br/> Since you cannot tell by looking if a man has a sexually transmitted infection or HIV, sex is safer only if you use a condom every time. If a man has a discharge coming from his penis or a sore somewhere on it, he has an infection and will almost certainly give it to you!
Family	Advice for Girls	How does my body change during puberty?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-02.mp3	 All girls go through changes in their bodies, but the changes happen differently for each girl.

Family	Advice for Girls	How should I decide about Boyfriends and Sex?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-08.mp3	 Most young people begin to have loving or sexual feelings as they get older. Thinking about touching or being touched by someone in a sexual way is not unusual. (Girls may even think about another girl or woman in this way.) But people often have these feelings before they are ready to act on them. <br/> <br/> Only have sex when you decide that you are ready and know how to protect yourself from harm. Sex can be enjoyed by both people, but not if there is fear or shame. <br/> <br/> Young women have sex for many different reasons. Some do it because they want to have a baby. Others do it because it makes them feel good or wanted. Some women feel they have very little choice because it is their duty as a wife or girlfriend. Some trade sex for money or for other things they need to survive, such as food, or clothes for their children, or a place to live. <br/> <br/> Others have sex because they think it will make someone love them more. Sometimes a friend or a boyfriend can make a girl feel that she should have sex when she is not ready. <br/> <br/> No one should have sex when she does not want to. Only have sex when you decide you are ready. Sex can be enjoyed by both people, but it is difficult to enjoy something when you feel fear or shame, or have not given consent.
Family	Advice for Girls	What are special health needs of girls?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-01.mp3	 Sometime between the ages of 10 and 15, a girl’s body begins to grow and change into an adult body. These can be exciting and difficult years. A young woman may not feel exactly like a girl or a woman - her body is somewhere in between and is doing new things she is not used to. What can make it harder is when no one talks about the changes, and so a girl may not know what to expect.  <br/> <br/> One of the most important things a girl can do to stay healthy is to eat well. Her body needs to get enough protein, vitamins, and minerals during her years of growth. A girl needs at least as much food as a boy. Getting enough to eat leads to less sickness and more success in school, healthier pregnancies, safer births, and a healthier old age.
Family	Advice for Girls	What is pressured or forced sex?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-13.mp3	 If someone has forced you to have sex when you do not want it, it is rape. <br/> <br/> All over the world, young girls and women are forced to have sex when they do not want to. Often it is done by boyfriends who claim to love them. In some places this is called ‘date rape’. The force may not only be physical. You can feel pressure from words or feelings. He may threaten you or say “please” or somehow make you feel guilty or ashamed if you do not have sex. This is still wrong.

Family	Advice for Girls	Why can early pregnancy be dangerous for me?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-08-09.mp3	 Most girls’ bodies are not ready for a safe and healthy birth.  <br/> <br/> Young women are more likely to develop pre-eclampsia (which can cause seizures, “fits”) during pregnancy.  <br/> <br/> Because their bodies may still be too small for a baby to come out, mothers under age 17 are more likely to have long, difficult labors, and blocked births. Without medical help, a woman with any of these problems can die. Blocked births can also damage the vagina, causing urine and stool to leak.  <br/> <br/> Babies born to girls younger than 17 are more likely to be born too small or too soon.

Going with an older man may seem very exciting, especially if he is well known or important in your community, or if he has money and can buy things. In some places a man who buys his girlfriend many presents is called a ‘Sugar Daddy’.  <br/> <br/> Often a girl who goes with an older man ends up feeling she was used for sex or treated badly, especially if the man is married or has other women. <br/> <br/> Sometimes an older man can make a young woman feel more pressured to have sex than boys her own age can, especially if he has power over her.

Cholera can occur where there is poor sanitation and overcrowding.  <br/> <br/> An epidemic (or outbreak) of disease can cause an emergency because of the severity of the disease or responses to it. In the case of pandemic influenza and other diseases spread by close personal contact, those who are ill should be kept separated from others. <br/> <br/> Influenza symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhoea.

Family	Child Health	Should every child be immunized?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-07-05.mp3	 Many parents do not take a child to be immunized because the child has a fever, cough, cold, diarrhoea or some other illness. However, it is safe to immunize a child who has a minor illness. <br/> <br/> It is also safe to immunize a child who has a disability or is malnourished. If a child is HIV-positive or suspected to be HIV-positive, a trained health worker should be consulted about which vaccines to give the child. <br/> <br/> After an injection, the child may cry or develop a fever, a minor rash or a small sore. This is normal and shows that the vaccine is working. Children under 6 months of age should breastfeed frequently; older children should be given plenty of liquids and foods. If the child develops a high fever (over 38 degrees Celsius) the child should be taken to a trained health worker or health centre.
Family	Child Health	What immunizations does my child need?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-07-04.mp3	 All children need to be immunized with BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine, which offers partial protection against some forms of tuberculosis and leprosy. <br/> <br/> All children need to be immunized against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis with DTP vaccine (also known as DPT vaccine). Diphtheria causes infection of the upper respiratory tract, which in severe cases may lead to breathing difficulties and death. Tetanus causes rigid muscles and painful muscle spasms and can be deadly. Pertussis, or whooping cough, affects the respiratory tract and can cause a cough that lasts four to eight weeks. The disease is very dangerous in infants. <br/> <br/> All pregnant women and infants need to be immunized against tetanus.  <br/> <br/> All children need to be immunized against measles, which can be a major cause of malnutrition, poor mental development, and hearing and visual impairments. The signs that a child has measles are a fever and rash, together with a cough, a runny nose or red eyes. A child can die from measles. <br/> <br/> All children need to be immunized against polio. The signs of polio are a floppy limb or the inability to move. For every 200 children infected, one will be disabled for life.
Family	Child Health	What is diarrhoea and why is it dangerous for my child?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-07-01.mp3	 Diarrhoea is caused by germs that are swallowed, especially germs from faeces. This happens most often where there is unsafe disposal of faeces, poor hygiene practices, lack of clean drinking water, or when infants are not breastfed. <br/> <br/> Diarrhoea kills children by draining liquid from the body, which dehydrates the child. Children are more likely than adults to die from diarrhoea because they become dehydrated and malnourished more quickly. As soon as diarrhoea starts, it is essential to give the child extra fluids along with regular foods and fluids. <br/> <br/> A child has diarrhoea when she or he passes three or more watery stools a day. The more numerous the watery stools, the more dangerous the diarrhoea.
Family	Child Health	Why is immunization so important?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-07-03.mp3	 Each year, over 1.4 million children die from diseases that are preventable with readily available vaccines. <br/> <br/> Immunization protects children against some of the most dangerous diseases of childhood. All children, including those who are disabled, need to be vaccinated. A child is immunized by vaccines, which are injected or given by mouth. The vaccines work by building up the child's defences against diseases. Immunization only works if given before the disease strikes. <br/> <br/> A child who is not immunized is very likely to get measles, whooping cough and many other diseases that can kill. Children who survive these diseases are weakened and may not grow well. They may be permanently disabled. They may die later from malnutrition and other illnesses. <br/> <br/> Children who are immunized are protected from these dangerous diseases, which can often lead to disability or death. All children have the right to this protection.

Sharp metal objects, machinery and rusty cans can cause wounds that can become badly infected. <br/> <br/> Families can reduce the risk of children's injuries from glass and sharp objects if they: <br/> <ul><li> keep glass bottles out of reach of young children and keep the house and play area free of broken glass and refuse</li><li>place knives, razors and scissors in drawers or locked cabinets well out of reach of young children</li><li>safely dispose of household refuse, including broken bottles and old cans.</li></ul> <li> keep glass bottles out of reach of young children and keep the house and play area free of broken glass and refuse</li>  keep glass bottles out of reach of young children and keep the house and play area free of broken glass and refuse <li>place knives, razors and scissors in drawers or locked cabinets well out of reach of young children</li> place knives, razors and scissors in drawers or locked cabinets well out of reach of young children <li>safely dispose of household refuse, including broken bottles and old cans.</li> safely dispose of household refuse, including broken bottles and old cans. <p>Other injuries around the home can be prevented by teaching children about the dangers of throwing stones or other sharp objects and of playing with knives or scissors.<br/><br/>Plastic bags should be kept away from young children to prevent suffocation.<br/><br/><br/></p> Other injuries around the home can be prevented by teaching children about the dangers of throwing stones or other sharp objects and of playing with knives or scissors.
Family	Child Injury Prevention	How can I prevent my child from poisoning injuries?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-06-13.mp3	 The key to preventing poisoning is to keep harmful substances out of children's reach. <br/> <br/> Poisons should never be put in soft drink or beer bottles, jars or cups, as children may drink them by mistake. All medicines, chemicals and poisons should be stored in their original containers, tightly sealed and out of children's reach. <br/> <br/> Detergents, bleaches, chemicals and medicines should never be left where children can reach them. They should be tightly sealed and labelled. They should also be locked in a cupboard or trunk or put on a high shelf where children cannot see or reach them. <br/> <br/> Medicines meant for adults can kill or injure small children. Medicine should only be given to a child if it is prescribed for that child. It should never be given to a child if it is prescribed for an adult or some other child. A child should never take medication on his or her own. The parent or other caregiver should give the medication to the child each time it is needed. Medication should be stored out of reach and sight of children.

Family	Child Injury Prevention	Why is it important for parents to think carefully about child injury prevention?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-06-01.mp3	<br/> Every year, nearly 1 million children die from injuries. Tens of millions more require hospital care for non-fatal injuries. Many are left with permanent disabilities or brain damage. <br/> <br/> Injuries affect children of all ages. Girls and boys under 5 years of age are at particular risk. More boys than girls die from injuries. <br/> <br/> The most common injuries are traffic injuries, non-fatal drowning (sometimes referred to as near drowning), burns, falls and poisoning. <br/> <br/> Traffic injuries and drowning are the leading causes of injury-related death. <br/> <br/> The most common place for young children to be injured is in or around their homes. <br/> <br/> Almost all injuries can be prevented.
Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with conflicts about carrying or giving birth to a baby girl?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-10.mp3	 The following are some strategies you may use to defend yourself and your baby girl if your husband or his family are putting pressure on you to abort a female foetus:  <br/> <br/> 1. Point out to your husband and his family that without women no boy child can ever be born and therefore a girl child is always a blessing on society and necessary for the continuation of life in this world. <br/> <br/> 2. Explain to your husband that girls are pillars of the society. A girl can be a good daughter, a good sister, a good wife and, in the future, a good mother. If the practice of abortion continues for the next few years, we surely will see a day without mothers and thus no life. Without daughters, we have no future. <br/> <br/> 3. Tell your husband that girls are usually more obedient than boys. In general, girls show more responsibility, devotion and respect for their family, job, society or country than boys, and often they care a lot more about their parents than boys do.  <br/> <br/> 4. If your husband and his family are still not convinced and blame you for "only having girls" ensure that they are aware of the following scientifically proven facts (which any doctor or health worker will confirm to be true, should your husband doubt it):  <br/> <ul><li> a baby‘s gender is determined at conception - and it is the male's sperm that dictates whether the baby will be a boy or a girl. We all get genetic material from both our parents, which is why children look like both their mother and father. </li><li>Prior to conception, the unfertilized egg of a woman only carries a genetic material called an X-chromosome.

Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with conflicts about family planning and child spacing?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-12.mp3	 In order to resolve conflicts regarding family planning it will be necessary for you to talk  with your husband or partner about the use of family planning and about the method you will use. To facilitate the conversation it may be helpful to share the following information with him:  <br/> <ul><li> Women under the age of 18 are more likely to die in childbirth because their bodies are not fully grown, and their babies have a greater chance of dying during their first year of life. So it is better not to have babies too soon. </li><li>Older women face more danger in childbearing, especially if they have other health problems or have had many children.

So it is better not to have babies too closely after one another. </li><li>A woman with more than four children has a greater risk of death after childbirth from bleeding and other causes. So it is better not to have too many babies.</li><li>Having fewer children means less economic pressure on the family and will allow a husband to take better care of his family.

Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with conflicts about marital roles?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-05.mp3	 In most countries men are in positions of power so obtaining their support and help can be very important. If you intend looking for employment or would like to start your own business having the support of your husband could be enormously helpful. <br/> <br/> If you think your husband may be against your plans, try using the following strategies to gain his support:  <br/> <br/> 1. Before talking to your husband think very carefully about your plans. If you do not know exactly what you want to do, and how you are going to do it, how can he be expected to understand your plans and to support you?  <br/> <br/> 2. Take a firm, but non-confrontational, stand in discussions with him about what you want to do. It is important you discuss your ideas with your husband but you will almost certainly achieve more by staying calm and friendly than by yelling at him or by crying.  <br/> <br/> 3. Execute your plans in consultation with your husband. If you ask for his help and advice he will almost certainly feel less insecure and suspicious about what you are doing and should recognise that you can both profit from the changes you are striving for.  <br/> <br/> 4. Explain to your husband that his life will improve if he supports you because your family income will increase and you want to spend the money you earn on your family and home. <br/> <br/> 5. Point out to your husband that as the head of a wealthier family his status, and the prestige of your family in the community, will increase once you are earning money. Some men are afraid others will look down on them if they are no longer the sole wage earner of their family. Explain to him that this is rarely true and that, in most cases, the husbands of working wives enjoy even more respect.  <br/> <br/> 6. Suggest to your husband that the incremental income from your work could allow you both, together, to provide a better education for all your children (boys and girls). Every father cares about the future of his children and recognises that in the modern world a good education is the key to success and a well-paid job. If your husband wants the best for his children he should not deny them this opportunity.  <br/> <br/> 7. Demonstrate - using as examples women who have gone out to work or who have successfully started businesses in the same way you want to - how their families have benefited.   <br/> <br/> 8. If, after attempting all of the above, your husband is still reluctant to allow you to work, try to find other family members to help you resolve the conflict and to support you. You could also meet with other women to seek their help and support and to ask how they managed to change their husbands‘ minds. 
Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with conflicts about treatment and education of daughters?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-11.mp3	 The following are some thoughts you may be able to use to convince your husband to allow your daughters access to a good education:  <br/> <br/> It is only the positive thinking and action of parents with regards to treating and appreciating all their children in the same way, no matter whether they are boys or girls, which can, and must, change the whole society. A female child should be given access and opportunities in every field equivalent to a male child because girls are as valuable as boys.  <br/> <br/> Girls are not less capable than boys in any field. On the contrary, in school and at university, girls usually outperform boys. If proof is needed just refer to any recent set of examination results.  <br/> <br/> People want educated daughters-in-law but are often reluctant to educate their own daughters. This is neither fair nor realistic.  <br/> <br/> There is a well-known saying: “If you educate your daughter, you educate two families.“ It is very pertinent to the discussion because, by educating a son you only educate one person whereas by educating a daughter you are not only educating her but also, potentially, a future new family.
Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with conflicts over household chores?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-07.mp3	 The following are some strategies for dealing with conflicts over household chores: <br/> <br/> 1. Do not think you have to face all your problems on your own. Not sharing your problems with others will increase not only your stress level but could be bad for your health and could also negatively impact on the rest of your family, too. So share your feelings with a few people you trust. Even if your problems are not resolved right away, talking about them will reduce stress and tension.  <br/> <br/> 2. Make an effort to get people around you (family members, friends, neighbours) to help with your problems. If help is not forthcoming, try asking again using different ways to explain the things that bother you. Whilst not everyone will understand or be supportive, sooner or later someone will recognise your needs and provide support. Sometimes men just do not recognise that a woman may need help because they are just not aware of all the work a woman has to do. So try to motivate your whole family to work as a team for the sake of your children.  <br/> <br/> 3. Try to encourage your husband to spend time playing with and taking care of your children. Many men think that only women should take care of babies and young children, but this is wrong as studies have shown that babies and children whose fathers get involved in their upbringing and education develop much better than others and become more intelligent when they grow up. So, ask your husband if perhaps he could play with, sing to or talk to your baby at least once a day or ask him if he could perhaps bathe, massage, or settle the baby to sleep.  <br/> <br/> 4. Share your problems with other women. Women often feel anxious and shy about discussing their problems with others because they think no one will understand them or that people will look down on them if they talk about their difficulties.  However, by not making an effort to meet or talk to other women, they potentially lose many opportunities to get, and give, support within their society. You could try forming a small group of women who can meet together from time to time to talk about their problems by inviting some of your friends, friends of friends, neighbours or women you work with to meet together. You will find out that many of them are facing exactly the same problems as you and can probably  find ways to support each other by, for instance, sharing tasks like cooking or taking care of children once or twice a week. 
Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with conflicts over sex?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-13.mp3	 Sexual desire is a natural part of life, and a woman can feel as much sexual desire and pleasure as a man. Traditionally women are often taught that it is their duty as a wife to  submit to their husband's sexual demands and that 'good' women do not have sexual desires of their own. This is wrong and harmful teaching. It is both good, and natural, for women and men to want to share sexual pleasure with their partners. When each partner knows the kind of sexual talk and touching that the other likes, they can both enjoy sex more. <br/> <br/> Talk to your partner about sex. This can be very hard if you have never done it before, but it is very important. If you do not, how can he know that you are not enjoying sex? Tell him what you like and what you do not like. Your partner may simply not realize that your body responds differently to sexual touch from the way his own body does. Teach him how to make you feel excited.  <br/> <br/> Sex often begins with kissing, touching, talking, or looking in a way that makes a person feel excited. It often takes longer for a woman to get excited or reach orgasm than a man. Therefore, ask your partner to take time and be patient while having sex with you.  <br/> <br/> It is possible for almost all women to have orgasms, but many women never have them or have them only once in a while. If she wants, a woman may be able to learn how to have an orgasm, either by touching herself or by letting her partner know what feels good. Touching oneself does not use up sexual desire, and can be a good way for a woman to learn about her body and what kinds of sexual touch feel best - and to show it to her partner.  <br/> <br/> The amount of desire a woman feels may change throughout her monthly cycle, or at certain times during her life. If you or your partner do not feel like having sex, try to forgive each other and to talk about it. Allow time for sex when you both want it, and try to do things that you both will find exciting. <br/> <br/> Sex should never be painful. Pain during sex is usually a sign that something is wrong. A woman may feel pain with sex when: <br/> <ul><li> her partner enters her too soon before she is relaxed or wet enough.</li><li>she feels guilt or shame or does not want to have sex.</li><li>she has an infection (you should see a health worker to check this). </li><li>she has had a genital cutting. </li></ul> <li> her partner enters her too soon before she is relaxed or wet enough.</li>  her partner enters her too soon before she is relaxed or wet enough. <li>she feels guilt or shame or does not want to have sex.</li> she feels guilt or shame or does not want to have sex. <li>she has an infection (you should see a health worker to check this). </li> she has an infection (you should see a health worker to check this).  <li>she has had a genital cutting. </li>
Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with dowry conflicts?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-15.mp3	 In many countries (for example in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Kenya) the request, payment, or acceptance of any sum presented as a requirement for marriage is strictly forbidden by law with anyone guilty of breaking the law subject to a custodial sentence.  <br/> <br/> Unfortunately, many families are still not aware of the law and of the recourse available to wives and their families in the event that a wedding dowry is demanded. Others think that filing a complaint with the authorities would lead to the damage of their social status. So the tradition often lives on, although it should not.  <br/> <br/> Disputes about dowry issues are still frequent and often when parents-in-law do not get a dowry that meets their satisfaction, they result in the maltreatment of the daughter-in-law and can even lead to the husband threatening his young wife with desertion if she does not bring a big enough dowry from her parents.  <br/> <br/> If you are being ill-treated by your husband‘s family because of a dowry conflict the following strategies may assist you to defend yourself: <br/> <br/> 1. Try to contact a women‘s organization in your region (if available) to ask for information and help. <br/> <br/> 2. If this is not possible, try to talk to someone in authority you trust (e.g. a health worker or a religious leader of your community) or to other women you know about their experiences with dowry conflicts. Some of them may be able to support or advise you as you are certainly not the only one with this type of problem.  <br/> <br/> 3. Try to find supportive neighbours and relatives who are willing to assist and support you. In many cases, just a small group of people willing to intervene on your behalf will be sufficient to let the in-laws know that their behaviour will not be tolerated.  <br/> <br/> 4. Talk to your parents, brothers and other family relatives because you have the same right to support and help as any of your brothers. It is their duty, if necessary, to take you back into the family home to save you from abuse and/or violence. By seeking their help you are not making yourself a burden nor an object of charity because your parents and relatives must give priority to saving your life and to helping you rebuild a new life. Tell them if necessary that if they are not willing to take you back and make you feel welcome in their home, they would be as guilty of your misuse and, in the worst case, of your murder as your in-laws.  <br/> <br/> 5. You may also consider legal action if you live in a country where dowry is forbidden and punishable by law. However, you should think carefully before going to the police or to court because in many countries where dowry is still practised, the legal system, unfortunately, is often inefficient and venal and all your effort might be in vain. So choose your battle wisely and, if possible, contact a women‘s organization before taking any action as they may help you to evaluate your chances of success.  <br/>
Family	Family Conflicts	How can I deal with other conflicts with my in-laws?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-16.mp3	 Whatever type of conflict you have with your in-laws it is very important to gain the support of your husband in order to change a situation that bothers you. Your in-laws are his parents, they probably love him madly, and will, therefore, more readily give way to his wishes than to yours.  <br/> <br/> It is therefore always a good start gaining his support and sympathy in order to solve problems with your in-laws and the following strategies may help you do so: <br/>   <ul><li> When seeking help from your husband keep calm, do not yell or cry. Explain the things that bother you and make sure he understands what exactly is upsetting you. If at first he does not understand the issues, try again and again until he does. It is vital that you convince him of the need for his support. </li><li>Try not to attack him, to reproach him or to offend him. If you do he will start to defend himself (which is a human reflex) and may no longer be willing to listen to your explanations. Be nice, not angry. Try not to see him as part of your problem but as part of the solution to your problem. As your husband, he is your natural ally, not your enemy (at least he should be) so do not put pressure on him, instead, ensure that he understands you are asking for his help. </li><li>A frequent issue for many couples is that the wife wants to leave his husband‘s parents‘ home and set up a nuclear family. Whilst this may be entirely understandable many men hesitate to agree. Should this be your problem, try to understand and respect your husband‘s loyalties towards his parents and do not question them. Instead, try to explain what exactly is bothering you about your current living situation and together look for possible changes that might satisfy you without challenging (too much) his loyalties towards his parents. Hopefully, it will be possible to make some adjustments to your living arrangements instead of moving out. If not, remind him - firmly but gently - that as your husband he now owes you some loyalty too. </li><li>Never think that by talking to your husband about your worries and problems you will create further conflict. The worst possible thing that can happen to a married couple is for them to stop talking to one another. Should this happen it will undoubtedly worsen the situation so continuing to talk to one another is vital in any relationship. Keeping your feelings to yourself all the time can only increase stress and tension. </li><li>Never think your husband will not understand you, or your problems, and that it is pointless discussing them with him. If initially he does not understand you must try harder to make him understand.  Men and women are different in many respects. They think, feel and act differently. They live different lives and often have different views on many things. So do not get impatient if your husband needs time to understand you or the problems you are trying to explain. </li></ul> <li> When seeking help from your husband keep calm, do not yell or cry.

Family	Family Conflicts	How can I raise children for a better world ?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-17.mp3	 Although you and your husband may have your different ideas about how to raise children it is important that you discuss and agree on any differences to ensure your children‘s welfare - which is undoubtedly of paramount importance to both of you.  <br/> <br/> Your children will be suffering if their mother is suffering, so try to bridge or - if possible - overcome your differences for their sake.  <br/> <br/> If necessary remind your husband that a happy relationship between their parents is best for the psychological and physical well-being of your children and remember that, as mothers, every day of their lives, we teach our children that: <br/> <ul><li> girls’ and women’s hunger is less important when we feed our husbands and sons first.</li><li>girls do not deserve the opportunities that come from an education when we only send our sons to school.</li><li>we raise violent men when we teach our sons that it is manly to be violent</li><li>we teach our sons that it is acceptable for a man to beat his wife and children when we do not speak out against violence in our neighbour’s house.</li></ul> <li> girls’ and women’s hunger is less important when we feed our husbands and sons first.</li>  girls’ and women’s hunger is less important when we feed our husbands and sons first. <li>girls do not deserve the opportunities that come from an education when we only send our sons to school.</li> girls do not deserve the opportunities that come from an education when we only send our sons to school. <li>we raise violent men when we teach our sons that it is manly to be violent</li> we raise violent men when we teach our sons that it is manly to be violent <li>we teach our sons that it is acceptable for a man to beat his wife and children when we do not speak out against violence in our neighbour’s house.</li> we teach our sons that it is acceptable for a man to beat his wife and children when we do not speak out against violence in our neighbour’s house. <p>As mothers, we have the power to change who our children will become, and can teach our:</p> As mothers, we have the power to change who our children will become, and can teach our: <ul><li>sons to be kind and compassionate, so they will grow up to be kind and compassionate husbands, fathers, and brothers.</li><li>daughters to value themselves, so they will expect the same from others. </li><li>sons to share and take pride in household work, so their sisters, wives, and daughters do not suffer the burden of overwork.</li><li>daughters to be more independent by finishing school or learning a skill.</li><li>sons to respect all women and to be responsible sexual partners.</li></ul> <li>sons to be kind and compassionate, so they will grow up to be kind and compassionate husbands, fathers, and brothers.</li> sons to be kind and compassionate, so they will grow up to be kind and compassionate husbands, fathers, and brothers. <li>daughters to value themselves, so they will expect the same from others. </li> daughters to value themselves, so they will expect the same from others.  <li>sons to share and take pride in household work, so their sisters, wives, and daughters do not suffer the burden of overwork.</li> sons to share and take pride in household work, so their sisters, wives, and daughters do not suffer the burden of overwork.
Family	Family Conflicts	What are common conflicts about roles?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-04.mp3	 In general, employment is very important and positive for women - earning their own money brings them more control and influence within the family, increased independence, higher social status, and more social contact.  <br/> <br/> If both partners are earning money, the family has more income and can have a better life, and many women say they feel proud and more satisfied when working and assuming more economic responsibility for their families. However, some men do not like their women being more independent and self-confident.  <br/> <br/> In many countries and cultures providing for a family has, traditionally, been strongly perceived to be a male responsibility. So to have their women working makes some men afraid of losing their traditional position as head of the family and they are unhappy about their wives giving up the traditional roles and behaviour expected by their society.  <br/> <br/> Sometimes men are afraid their woman may leave them or betray them with another man whilst working away from home. Other men believe that women, in general, should not leave their homes at all to work; they think the outside world may spoil them or that women are not capable of standing their ground in the outside world.  <br/> <br/> Once a woman is earning her own money she often expects to have more respect, influence, and recognition within the family. She may for example want to play a significant role in family decision-making (e.g. about what to spend the family‘s money on). Many men do not like this at all and prefer being the unquestioned head of the family. 
Family	Family Conflicts	What are common conflicts over children?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-08.mp3	 In many countries females are not valued or respected by their families. Many families, especially in developing countries, prefer boys to girls because boys are expected to provide support to their parents in old age. Therefore, families are more likely to provide their sons, rather than daughters, with all available health care and education. Many women no longer agree with this custom; they want better lives for their daughters and are willing to challenge traditions and discuss with their husbands how to treat and educate all their children irrespective of their sexes.  <br/> <br/> As a result of the widespread belief that girls are a burden on their families and on society, and despite the fact that it is banned by law everywhere in the world, in many countries some families still pressure  pregnant women to abort a female foetus and even to (passively) murder young girls through the denial of food and other necessities such as health care. In India, for example, around 750,000 girls are being aborted annually so it can be very hard for a woman to save a girl child. 
Family	Family Conflicts	What are common conflicts over household chores?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-06.mp3	 In many countries, women alone, are traditionally responsible for looking after the home. <br/>   <br/> Women take care of their husbands, his parents or other relatives, their children and the sick and elderly. They gather firewood and water for drinking, they do the cooking and washing, they do the cleaning, the gardening, the crop farming, and often they take care of any animals the family may have.  <br/> <br/> Lack of access to childcare facilities and/or health and support services in many regions of the world means that caring for family members, in addition to her other household chores, can take up a huge amount of a woman’s time and can severely limit her ability to take on paid employment. <br/> <br/> These “household chores” can be a huge burden for a woman who is strong and healthy and has the whole day to devote to them. They can also severely limit a woman’s ability to take on paid employment and the volume of work may become impossible for a woman to deal with if she is weak or becomes ill.  <br/> <br/> When  women ask their husbands for help it is often denied them on the grounds that “household chores” are considered to be ”woman‘s work“ - even if the women also work away from home to help support their families financially.  <br/> <br/> Studies have shown that women in developing countries, on average, spend three hours per day more than men on unpaid work such as household chores and on caring for children and elderly relatives. The studies also show that women with many young children may find it especially difficult to meet all the demands on their time.  <br/> <br/> Furthermore, whilst in many countries women are most often responsible for running the home, raising the children and for primary care giving, they have little influence over important household decisions or household expenditure and they often feel excluded from these decisions. 
Family	Family Conflicts	What are common conflicts over sex?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-09.mp3	 Some men do not want their wives to use family planning - often because they do not know very much about how different methods work. The reason may also be that they are worried about their wives' health because they have heard stories about the dangers of family planning, they may fear that if a woman uses family planning she will have sex with other men or they may think it is ‘manly’ to have lots of children. <br/> <br/> Arranged marriages are still common practice in many countries. The bride and groom  have little or no say in what happens and following the wedding young girls are often isolated from their own families. In many communities, a woman becomes the property of her husband, who, after the marriage, may believe that he has the right to use her body for his pleasure whenever he wants.  <br/> <br/> Under these circumstances, many women find it very difficult to love their husband and to enjoy sex with him. Instead, they may feel they are being pressured into having sex with someone they do not know very well or possibly do not even like. They may reject their husband, or keep finding excuses why they cannot have sex with him. When this happens the husbands may get angry and force them to have sex, which can lead to a “vicious circle“, of the women resenting and rejecting their husband even more. 
Family	Family Conflicts	What are common conflicts with in-laws?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-14.mp3	 In many countries, once a woman marries, she is expected to leave her birth family and go to live with her husband‘s family.  For many young women, this separation causes much suffering because they not only miss their parents and siblings but feel lonely, isolated and without support in their husband‘s family.  <br/> <br/> Poverty plus custom and practice in developing countries, often drive extended families to live together under the same roof and mean that young married couples are forced to live according to the traditional values and customs of their parents and grandparents.  <br/> <br/> Under these circumstances, in-laws may make life very difficult for the young woman and may interfere in her relationship with her husband. Some typical examples of the type of interference that may be experienced are:  <br/> <ul><li> the young woman will be required to help them a lot and to take care of them if they are in need.</li><li>in-laws may disapprove of the marriage and consequently will not treat their daughter-in-law very well. </li><li>in-laws may put a lot of pressure on a young wife in the event that she does not bring value to the family by bearing sons or providing income to the family. </li><li>if the family home a young man brings his wife to live in is very small there may be very little space made available for the daughter-in-law and her in-laws may even limit the amount of food and other necessities available to their daughter-in-law because they do not want to spend money on her.</li><li>in-laws may even ill-treat or abuse their daughters-in-law: </li></ul> <li> the young woman will be required to help them a lot and to take care of them if they are in need.</li>  the young woman will be required to help them a lot and to take care of them if they are in need. <li>in-laws may disapprove of the marriage and consequently will not treat their daughter-in-law very well. </li> in-laws may disapprove of the marriage and consequently will not treat their daughter-in-law very well.  <li>in-laws may put a lot of pressure on a young wife in the event that she does not bring value to the family by bearing sons or providing income to the family. </li> in-laws may put a lot of pressure on a young wife in the event that she does not bring value to the family by bearing sons or providing income to the family.  <li>if the family home a young man brings his wife to live in is very small there may be very little space made available for the daughter-in-law and her in-laws may even limit the amount of food and other necessities available to their daughter-in-law because they do not want to spend money on her.</li> if the family home a young man brings his wife to live in is very small there may be very little space made available for the daughter-in-law and her in-laws may even limit the amount of food and other necessities available to their daughter-in-law because they do not want to spend money on her. <li>in-laws may even ill-treat or abuse their daughters-in-law: </li> in-laws may even ill-treat or abuse their daughters-in-law:  <p>by abusing or insulting her, or by passing sarcastic remarks<br/>by assaulting her<br/>by denying her food or starving her<br/>by prohibiting her from going out and meeting anyone<br/>by refusing visits to her parents‘ home<br/>by not permitting her to talk with visitors from her parents‘ home<br/>by denying her access to her children<br/><br/><br/><br/></p> by abusing or insulting her, or by passing sarcastic remarks <br/> by assaulting her <br/> by denying her food or starving her <br/> by prohibiting her from going out and meeting anyone <br/> by refusing visits to her parents‘ home <br/> by not permitting her to talk with visitors from her parents‘ home
Family	Family Conflicts	What are common family conflicts?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-01.mp3	 Modern times have brought about many changes to traditional attitudes and values in many countries. Being a good wife and mother is still considered to be very important by most women (and their families). But nowadays, many women do not just want to stay at home and take care of household chores and family issues - they  also want to work to earn money. Doing so adds to the workload of women and often makes it difficult for them to live in peace and harmony with their husbands, children, and other family members.

Family	Family Conflicts	Which harmful beliefs can cause family conflicts?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-02.mp3	 Unfortunately, in many countries, gender inequality and unequal power relations between men and women still exist. This inequality is often rooted in harmful wrong beliefs, such as:  <br/> <ul><li> Men are superior to women. </li><li>Women are worthless and a burden to their families. </li><li>Men have proprietary rights over women. </li><li>What happens behind closed doors in the family setting is a private matter. </li></ul> <li> Men are superior to women. </li>  Men are superior to women.  <li>Women are worthless and a burden to their families. </li> Women are worthless and a burden to their families.  <li>Men have proprietary rights over women. </li> Men have proprietary rights over women.  <li>What happens behind closed doors in the family setting is a private matter. </li> What happens behind closed doors in the family setting is a private matter.  <p>Many families value boys more than girls because boys can contribute more to the family’s wealth, support their parents in old age, perform ceremonies after their parents die, and can carry on the family name. As a result, girls are often breastfed for a shorter time, are given less food and medical care, and receive little or no education.<br/><br/>In many communities, a woman cannot own or inherit property, earn money, or get credit. If she gets divorced, she may not be allowed to keep her children or her belongings. Even if a woman has legal rights, her community’s traditions may allow her little control over her life.

Family	Family Planning	How can I talk with my husband or partner about family planning?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-05.mp3	 It is best if you can talk together with your husband or partner about choosing to use family planning and what method you will use. <br/> <br/> Some men do not want their wives to use family planning, often because they do not know very much about how different methods work. A man may worry about his wife’s health, because he has heard stories about the dangers of family planning. He may fear that if a woman uses family planning, she will have sex with another man. Or he may also think it is ‘manly’ to have lots of children. <br/> <br/> Try sharing the information in this chapter with your partner. It may help him understand that: <br/> <ul><li> family planning will allow him to take better care of you and your children.</li><li>child spacing is safer for you and your children.</li><li>family planning can make sex with him more pleasant, because neither of you will have to worry about an unplanned pregnancy.

Family	Family Planning	How do barrier methods of family planning work?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-08.mp3	 Barrier methods prevent pregnancy by blocking the sperm from reaching the egg. They do not change the way the woman’s or man’s body works, and they cause very few side effects. Barrier methods are safe if a woman is breastfeeding. Most of these methods also protect against STIs, including HIV. When a woman wants to become pregnant, she simply stops using the barrier method.
Family	Family Planning	How do hormonal methods of family planning work?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-17.mp3	 These methods contain hormones, called estrogen and progestin, that are similar to the estrogen and progesterone a woman makes in her own body. Hormonal methods include: <br/> <ul><li> Pills, which a woman takes every day.</li><li>Injections, which are given every few months.</li><li>Implants, which are put into a woman’s arm and last for several years.</li></ul> <li> Pills, which a woman takes every day.</li>  Pills, which a woman takes every day. <li>Injections, which are given every few months.</li> Injections, which are given every few months. <li>Implants, which are put into a woman’s arm and last for several years.</li> Implants, which are put into a woman’s arm and last for several years. <p>A woman controls hormonal methods and they can be used without a man knowing.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT! Hormonal methods do not protect against STIs or HIV.<br/><br/>Hormonal methods work by preventing the woman’s ovaries from releasing an egg. The hormones also make the mucus at the opening of the womb very thick, which helps stop the sperm from getting inside the womb.<br/><br/>Most birth control pills and some injections contain both estrogen and progestin. These are called ‘combination’ pills or injections. The two hormones work together to give excellent protection against pregnancy. However, some women should not use pills or injections with estrogen for health reasons, or because they are breastfeeding.<br/><br/>Progestin-only pills (also called mini-pills), implants, and some injections contain only one hormone - progestin. These methods are safer than combined pills or injections for women who should not use estrogen, or are breastfeeding. <br/><br/><br/></p> A woman controls hormonal methods and they can be used without a man knowing. <br/> <br/> IMPORTANT!

Family	Family Planning	How do I stop taking the pill?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-27.mp3	
Family	Family Planning	How do I take combined birth control pills?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-25.mp3	 The pill comes in packets of 21 or 28 tablets. If you have a 28-day packet, take one pill every day of the month. As soon as you have finished one packet, begin taking pills from another packet. (The last 7 pills in a 28-day packet are made of sugar. They have no hormones in them. These sugar pills help you to remember to take a pill each day.) <br/> <br/> If you have a 21-day packet, take a pill every day for 21 days, then wait 7 days before beginning a new packet. Your monthly bleeding will usually happen during the days you are not taking pills. But begin a new packet even if your monthly bleeding has not come. <br/> <br/> With both 21-day and 28-day packets, take the first pill on the first day of your monthly bleeding. This way you will be protected right away. If it is after the first day, you can start taking a pill on any of the first 7 days of your monthly cycle. But you will not be protected right away, so for the first 2 weeks you are taking the pill you should also use another family planning method or not have sex.
Family	Family Planning	How do I use a condom for women (female condom)?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-12.mp3	 1. Carefully open the packet. <br/> <br/> 2. Find the inner ring, which is at the closed end of the condom. <br/> <br/> 3. Squeeze the inner ring together. <br/> <br/> 4. Put the inner ring in the vagina. <br/> <br/> 5. Push the inner ring up into your vagina with your finger. The outer ring stays outside the vagina. <br/> <br/> 6. When you have sex, guide the penis through the outer ring.
Family	Family Planning	How do I use a diaphragm?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-14.mp3	 1. If you have spermicide, squeeze it into the center. Then spread a little bit around the edge with your finger. <br/> <br/> 2. Squeeze the diaphragm in half. <br/> <br/> 3. Open the lips of your vagina with your other hand. Push the diaphragm into your vagina. It works best if you push it toward your back. <br/> <br/> 4. Check the position of your diaphragm by putting one of your fingers inside your vagina and feeling for your cervix through the rubber of the diaphragm. The cervix feels firm, like the end of your nose. The diaphragm must cover your cervix. <br/> <br/> 5. If the diaphragm is in the right place, you will not be able to feel it inside you. <br/> <br/> 6. Leave the diaphragm in place for at least 6 hours after sex. <br/> <br/> You can leave the diaphragm in for up to 24 hours. It is OK to use the diaphragm during monthly bleeding, but you will need to remove it and clean it as often as you would change a cloth or pad. <br/> <br/> To remove the diaphragm:
Family	Family Planning	How do I use spermicide?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-16.mp3	 1. Wash your hands with soap and water. <br/> <br/> 2. To use foam, shake the foam container rapidly, about 20 times. Then press the nozzle to fill the applicator.  <br/> <br/> To use jelly or cream, screw the spermicide tube onto the applicator. Fill the applicator by squeezing the spermicide tube.  <br/> <br/> To use vaginal tablets, remove the wrapping and wet them with water or spit on them. (DO NOT put the tablet in your mouth.)  <br/> <br/> 3. Gently put the applicator or vaginal tablet into your vagina, as far back as it will go. <br/> <br/> 4. If you are using an applicator, press in the plunger all the way and then take out the empty applicator. <br/> <br/> 5. Rinse the applicator with clean water and soap.
Family	Family Planning	How to use a condom for men?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-10.mp3	 1. If the man is not circumcised, pull the foreskin back. Squeeze the tip of the condom and put it on the end of the hard penis. <br/> <br/> 2. Keep squeezing the tip while unrolling the condom, until it covers all of the penis. The loose part at the end will hold the man’s sperm. If you do not leave space for the sperm when it comes out, the condom is more likely to break. <br/> <br/> 3. After the man ejaculates, he should hold on to the rim of the condom and withdraw from the vagina while his penis is still hard. <br/> <br/> 4. Take off the condom. Do not let sperm spill or leak. <br/> <br/> 5. Tie the condom shut and dispose of it away from children and animals.
Family	Family Planning	What are common side effects of combined pills?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-23.mp3	 Irregular bleeding or spotting (bleeding at other times than your normal monthly bleeding). Combined pills often make your monthly bleeding shorter and lighter. It is also normal to sometimes skip your monthly bleeding. This is the most common side effect of combined birth control pills. To reduce spotting, be extra careful to take the pill at the same time every day. If the spotting continues, talk with a health worker to see if changing doses of progestin or estrogen will help. <br/> If your monthly bleeding does not come at the normal time and you have missed some pills, continue to take your pills but see a health worker to find out if you are pregnant. <br/> <br/> Nausea, the feeling that you want to throw up, usually goes away after 1 or 2 months. If it bothers you, try taking the pills with food or at another time of day. Some women find that taking the pill just before going to sleep at night helps. <br/> <br/> Mild headaches in the first few months are common. A mild pain medicine should help. If the headache is severe or comes with blurred eyesight, this could be a serious warning sign. <br/> <br/> If you are bothered by any body changes after starting birth control pills, talk to a health worker. She might suggest a different pill. 
Family	Family Planning	What are other benefits of family planning?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-03.mp3	 As well as saving lives, family planning has other benefits:  <br/> <ul><li> Mothers and babies will be healthier, because risky pregnancies are avoided.</li><li>Fewer children means more food for each child.</li><li>Waiting to have children can allow young women and men time to complete their education, get a better job and contribute more to their families and communities.</li><li>Fewer children can mean more time for yourselves and your children.</li></ul> <li> Mothers and babies will be healthier, because risky pregnancies are avoided.</li>  Mothers and babies will be healthier, because risky pregnancies are avoided. <li>Fewer children means more food for each child.</li> Fewer children means more food for each child. <li>Waiting to have children can allow young women and men time to complete their education, get a better job and contribute more to their families and communities.</li> Waiting to have children can allow young women and men time to complete their education, get a better job and contribute more to their families and communities. <li>Fewer children can mean more time for yourselves and your children.</li> Fewer children can mean more time for yourselves and your children. <p>Family planning can also help you and your partner enjoy sex more, because you are not afraid of unwanted pregnancy.

Family	Family Planning	What should I do if I miss a pill?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-26.mp3	 If you miss pills you could get pregnant. <br/> <br/> If you forget 1 or 2 pills, take 1 pill as soon as you remember. Then take the next pill at the regular time. This may mean that you take 2 pills in one day. <br/> <br/> If you forget to take 3 pills, 3 days in a row, take 1 pill right away. Then take 1 pill each day at the regular time. <br/> <br/> If you are using a 28-day packet of pills, take only the hormone pills and skip the sugar pills, then start taking hormone pills from a new packet. If you are using a 21-day packet, start a new packet as soon as you finish the one you are taking now. Use condoms (or do not have sex) until you have taken a pill for 7 days in a row. <br/> <br/> If you forget to take more than 3 pills, stop taking the pills and wait for your next monthly bleeding. Use condoms (or do not have sex) for the rest of your cycle. Then start a new packet. <br/> <br/> Late or missed pills may cause some bleeding, like a very light monthly bleeding. <br/> <br/> If you have trouble remembering to take pills, try taking a pill when you do a daily task, like preparing the evening meal. Or take the pill when you see the sun go down or before you sleep. Keep the packet where you can see it every day. If you still forget to take your pills often (more than once a month), think about changing to a different method of birth control. 
Family	Family Planning	What should I know about combined pills (birth control pills with estrogen and progestin)?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-21.mp3	 Birth control pills will protect you from pregnancy as long as you take one pill every day. There are many different brands of combined pillswith different types of estrogen and progestin in them and different amounts of each hormone. The most common combined pills are “low-dose” pills with 20, 30, or 35 micrograms (mcg) of estrogen. Low-dose pills and minipills are different - lowdose pills have both estrogen and progestin, while the minipill has only progestin. Never use a method that contains more than 50 micrograms of estrogen. <br/> <br/> Combined pills are usually available at family planning clinics, health posts, pharmacies, and through health workers.
Family	Family Planning	What should I know about condoms for men?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-09.mp3	 The condom for men is a narrow bag of thin rubber that the man wears on his penis during sex. Because the man’s semen stays in the bag, the sperm cannot enter the woman’s body. <br/> <br/> Condoms offer a good protection from pregnancy. They are most effective when used with spermicide and water-based lubricant.  <br/> <br/> Condoms have no side effects. <br/> <br/> Condoms are the best protection against STIs and HIV. They can be used alone or along with any other family planning method. Condoms can be bought at many pharmacies and markets, and are often available at health posts and through AIDS prevention programs.  <br/> <br/> The condom must be put on the man’s penis when it is hard, but before it touches the woman’s genitals. If he rubs his penis on the woman’s genitals or goes into her vagina, he can make the woman pregnant or can give her an STI, even if he does not spill his sperm (ejaculate). <br/> <br/> If a condom breaks or comes off the penis, the woman should put spermicide in her vagina immediately. If possible, use emergency family planning. <br/> <br/> Remember: <br/> <ul><li> Use a condom every time you have sex.</li><li>A woman who is using another family planning method should also use condoms if she needs STI protection.</li><li>If possible, always use condoms made of latex. They give the best protection against HIV. Condoms made of sheepskin or lambskin may not protect against HIV.</li><li>Keep condoms in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Condoms from old or torn packages are more likely to break.</li><li>Use a condom only once. A condom that has been used before is more likely to break.</li><li>Keep condoms within reach. You are less likely to use them if you have to stop what you are doing to look for them.</li><li>At first, many couples do not like to use condoms. But once they get used to it, they may even recognize benefits besides protecting against unwanted pregnancies and STIs. For example, condoms can help some men last longer before they come.</li><li>Be careful not to tear the condom as you open the package. Do not use a new condom if the package is torn or dried out, or if the condom is stiff or sticky. The condom will not work.

Family	Family Planning	What should I know about condoms for women (female condoms)?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-11.mp3	 A female condom, which fits into the vagina and covers the outer lips of the vulva, can be put in the vagina any time before sex. It should be used only once, because it may break if it is reused. But if you do not have any other condoms, you can clean it and reuse it up to 5 times. The female condom should not be used with a male condom. <br/> <br/> Female condoms are larger than condoms made for men and are less likely to break. They work best when the man is on top and the woman is on the bottom during sex. <br/> <br/> The female condom is the most effective of the methods controlled by women in protecting against both pregnancy and STIs, including HIV. There are now 3 types of female condom available. The newest are less expensive. The VA female condom fits more closely to the woman’s body, so it is more comfortable and makes less noise during sex. <br/>
Family	Family Planning	What should I know about spermicide? (contraceptive foam, tablets, jelly, or cream)	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-15.mp3	 Spermicide comes in many forms - foam, tablets, and cream or jelly - and is put into the vagina just before having sex. Spermicide kills the man’s sperm before it can get into the womb. <br/> <br/> If used alone, spermicide is less effective than some other methods. But it is helpful when used as extra protection along with another method, like the diaphragm or condom. <br/> <br/> Spermicides can be bought in many pharmacies and markets. Some women find that some types of spermicides cause itching or irritation inside the vagina. <br/> <br/> Spermicides do not provide protection against any STI. Because spermicides can irritate the walls of the vagina, they may cause small cuts that allow HIV to pass more easily into the blood. <br/> <br/> When to insert spermicide: <br/> <br/> Tablets or suppositories should be put in the vagina 10 to 15 minutes before having sex. Foam, jelly, or cream work best if they are put in the vagina just before having sex.
Family	Family Planning	What should I know about the diaphragm?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-13.mp3	 The diaphragm is a shallow cup made of soft rubber or thin silicone that a woman wears in her vagina during sex. The diaphragm covers the cervix so that the man’s sperm cannot get into her womb.  <br/> <br/> When a diaphragm is used correctly, it prevents pregnancy most of the time and may also give some protection against STIs. The diaphragm should be used with spermicide. If you do not have spermicide, you can still use the diaphragm, but it may not work as well to prevent pregnancy. <br/> <br/> Diaphragms come in different sizes, and are available at some health posts and family planning clinics. A health worker who has been trained to do pelvic exams can examine you and find the right size diaphragm. A diaphragm is effective only when using the correct size. <br/> <br/> Diaphragms can get holes, particularly after being used for more than a year. It is a good idea to check your diaphragm often. Replace it when the rubber gets dry or hard, or when there is a hole in it.
Family	Family Planning	What should I know about the pill (combined pills and Minipills)?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-20.mp3	 The pills will not prevent pregnancy immediately. So, during the first 7 days on pills, use condoms or some other backup method to avoid pregnancy. <br/> <br/> If you must change to a lower dose pill, use a barrier method of family planning or do not have sex during the first month. <br/> <br/> Birth control pills will protect you from pregnancy as long as you take one pill every day. <br/> <br/> They may be dangerous for women with certain health problems.
Family	Family Planning	What types of family planning do exist?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-06.mp3	 Once you have decided to use family planning, you must choose a method.

Family	Family Planning	Why should family planning always be my choice?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-04-04.mp3	 Some women want a lot of children - especially in communities where poor people are denied a fair share of land, resources, and social benefits. This is because children help with work and provide care for their parents in old age. In these places, having just a few children may be a privilege only wealthier people can afford. <br/> <br/> Other women may want to limit the number of children they have. This often happens where women have opportunities to study and earn income, and where they can negotiate with men in a more equal way.

Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	How can I make all natural family planning methods more effective?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-07.mp3	 To make all natural family planning methods more effective: <br/> <br/> Have sex only on the days between the end of the fertile time and your next monthly bleeding. <br/> <br/> Use both the mucus method and the counting days method at the same time.
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	How can I prevent pregnancy by breastfeeding for the first 6 months (Lactational Amenorrhea Method, LAM)?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-02.mp3	 Breastfeeding under certain conditions can prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg. This method does not cost anything, but it is most effective for only the first 6 months after childbirth. <br/> <br/> Breastfeeding is an effective method of family planning only when these 3 conditions are true AT THE SAME TIME: <br/> <br/> 1. Your baby is less than 6 months old AND <br/> <br/> 2. You have not had your monthly bleeding since giving birth AND
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	How do I use the mucus method?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-09.mp3	 Do not have sex on any day you see or feel wetness or mucus. Or, if you want to have sex on those days, use a condom or a diaphragm without spermicide (these are the only methods that do not change the mucus). <br/> <br/> Do not have sex until 2 days after the last day of clear, slippery mucus. <br/> <br/> Do not have sex during your monthly bleeding. There is a small possibility you could be fertile and not be able to tell. <br/> <br/> Do not douche or wash out your vagina at any time. This will wash the mucus away.
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	How do natural methods of family planning work?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-01.mp3	 There are also 3 methods to avoid pregnancy that do not require any devices or chemicals (as with barrier methods) or medicines (as with hormonal methods).  <br/> <br/> The methods are: <br/> <ul><li> breastfeeding for the first 6 months</li><li>the mucus method</li><li>the counting days method</li></ul> <li> breastfeeding for the first 6 months</li>  breastfeeding for the first 6 months <li>the mucus method</li> the mucus method <li>the counting days method</li> the counting days method <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Natural methods of family planning do not protect against STIs, including HIV. If you use any of the natural methods listed in these pages, you still need to think about ways to protect yourself from these diseases.<br/><br/><br/></p>
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	How does the counting days method work?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-10.mp3	 With the counting days method, you do not have sexual intercourse during any time that you might be fertile. This method can be used only if you have regular cycles that last between 26 and 32 days. This means that the time from the first day of one monthly bleeding, to the first day of your next monthly bleeding, must be at least 26 days, and no more than 32 days. <br/>
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	How does the mucus method of family planning work?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-08.mp3	 To use the mucus method, you must pay careful attention to the mucus (wetness) in your vagina. Your body produces wet mucus during your fertile time to help the sperm get into the womb. So if you check your mucus every day, you will know when you are becoming fertile. Then you can avoid sex during this time. <br/> <br/> How to tell when you are fertile: <br/> <br/> 1. Wipe the outside of your vagina with your finger or a piece of paper or cloth. <br/> <br/> 2. If there is mucus there, take some between your fingers. How does it feel? Wet and slippery? Dry and sticky? <br/> <br/> clear, wet, slippery mucus = fertile
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	How to use the counting days method?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-11.mp3	 For this method to work, you cannot have sexual intercourse from the 8th day of your cycle through the 19th day of your cycle. If you have sexual intercourse during this time, you must use another method of family planning. <br/> <br/> You can use beads, a chart, or some other tool to remember your fertile days. String 32 beads, of 3 different colors, into a necklace. Each color bead can represent a different part of your cycle: <br/> <ul><li> A red bead marks the first day of your monthly bleeding.</li><li>6 blue beads show days when sexual intercourse will not usually cause pregnancy.</li><li>12 white beads show your fertile time  -  when sexual intercourse can cause pregnancy.</li><li>13 more blue beads show days when sexual intercourse will not usually cause pregnancy.</li></ul> <li> A red bead marks the first day of your monthly bleeding.</li>  A red bead marks the first day of your monthly bleeding. <li>6 blue beads show days when sexual intercourse will not usually cause pregnancy.</li> 6 blue beads show days when sexual intercourse will not usually cause pregnancy. <li>12 white beads show your fertile time  -  when sexual intercourse can cause pregnancy.</li> 12 white beads show your fertile time  -  when sexual intercourse can cause pregnancy. <li>13 more blue beads show days when sexual intercourse will not usually cause pregnancy.</li>
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	What do I have to know about my cycle of fertility to use the mucus and counting days method?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-05.mp3	 A woman releases one egg each month. <br/> <br/> The egg is released from the ovary about 14 days before the next monthly bleeding. <br/> <br/> The egg lives for about 24 hours (1 day and 1 night) after it has been released from the ovary. <br/>

Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	What should I know about sex without intercourse?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-15.mp3	 There are also ways to have sex that do not cause pregnancy. Oral sex (mouth on genitals) and sexual touch (touching the genitals or other parts of the body) are both sexual activities that many couples enjoy. They have very low risk of passing HIV and other STIs. Anal sex also cannot cause pregnancy, although HIV and other STIs can pass very easily this way. <br/>
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	What should I know about the mucus method and the counting days method?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-04.mp3	 To use either of these methods, you must understand when you are fertile during your monthly cycle. This is sometimes called ‘fertility awareness’. Then, to avoid pregnancy, you and your partner must not have sex, or must use a barrier method of family planning, during your fertile days.  <br/> <br/> Because there are no costs or side effects, these methods can be used by women who cannot or do not want to use other methods, or when other methods are not available. <br/> <br/> To practice fertility awareness more effectively, both you and your partner should visit a specially trained health worker to learn about your bodies and about fertility. It usually takes about 3 to 6 months of practice to learn how to use these methods.
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	What should I know about traditional and home methods of family planning?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-12.mp3	 Every community has traditional methods to prevent or stop pregnancy. Many of these can be very useful in limiting the number of children a couple has, although they are usually not as effective as modern methods. But some traditional methods are not effective at all, and some can even be very harmful. <br/> <br/> Traditional methods that work:  <br/> <ul><li> Withdrawal or pulling out (coitus interruptus)</li><li>Separating partners after childbirth</li><li>Sex without intercourse</li></ul> <li> Withdrawal or pulling out (coitus interruptus)</li>  Withdrawal or pulling out (coitus interruptus)

It takes about 30 minutes.
Family	Family Planning - Natural and Permanent Methods	What should I know about Vasectomy (the operation for the man)?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-05-18.mp3	 A vasectomy is a simple operation in which the tubes that carry the sperm from the testicles to the penis are cut. The man’s testicles are not cut. This operation can be done in any health center where there is a trained health worker. It takes only a few minutes to do.

Family	Sexual Violence	Can I be raped by someone I know?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-04.mp3	 Most women who are raped know the man who rapes them. If the woman must continue to have contact with him, it can make it very hard for her to recover from the rape and to tell others about it. <br/> <br/> <strong>Rape by a husband or ex-husband </strong> Rape by a husband or ex-husband  <br/> If the law or traditional custom treats a woman as the property of her husband, he may think he has the right to have sex whenever he wants, even if the woman does not want it. <br/> <br/> <strong>A woman can be raped by her boyfriend</strong> A woman can be raped by her boyfriend   <br/> Her boyfriend may say he has the right to have sex because he has spent money on her, because they have had sex before, because she has teased him sexually, or because he has offered to marry her. But if he forces her, it is still rape. A woman may find it hard to talk about this kind of rape, because she fears others will blame her. <br/> <br/> <strong>Sexual harassment </strong> Sexual harassment  <br/> A woman may be forced to have sex by a co-worker or by  her supervisor or boss so that she can keep her job.

Family	Sexual Violence	How can I avoid rape?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-06.mp3	 There is no one right or wrong way to behave to avoid rape. But there are some things a woman can do that may make her less likely to suffer some kinds of rape. What a woman does depends on how well she knows the man, how afraid she is, and how much danger she thinks she is in. Remember, if a woman is raped, it is not because she failed to avoid the rape, but because someone stronger forced himself on her. <br/> <br/> These ideas may help any woman avoid rape: <br/> <ul><li> Do your work with other women.

Ask her to write down everything that she finds because it will help prove to the police or to others in the community that you were raped.<br/><br/><br/></p> If you think you may want to report the rape to the police, do it as soon after the rape as possible. Do not wash before you go, and bring the clothes that you were wearing in a bag. These things can help you prove that you were raped. Take a friend with you, and ask to have a female health worker examine you, if possible.

Family	Sexual Violence	What can I do if I am sexually assaulted?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-11.mp3	 If a woman is able to resist her attacker, she will usually be able to avoid the rape, even if the rapist has a weapon. The more different ways a woman tries to keep from being raped, the more likely she is to be able to avoid the rape, or to suffer fewer injuries and mental health problems from the rape afterward. <br/> <br/> It is impossible to know ahead of time how a woman will react when someone is trying to rape her. Some women are filled with rage and feel strength they did not know they had. Others feel like they cannot move. If this should ever happen to you, know that you will do what you can. <br/> <br/> Here are some ideas that may help you during a sexual assault: <br/> <ul><li> Do not cry, plead, or give in. It usually does not help. In fact, women who try this often suffer more injuries than women who fight back.</li><li>Stay aware. Watch the rapist carefully. There may be times when he is not watching you, or when he loses his control.</li><li>Try different things. Kick, yell, bargain, trick him -  do whatever you can think of to make him realize you are not an easy victim. Try to make him realize that you are a person, not an object.</li><li>If you know the rapist, tell him how you feel. Do not let him believe that women like to be raped. Make him be aware of what he is doing to you.</li><li>If the rapist is a stranger, try to memorize what he looks like. How big is he? Does he have scars, marks, or tattoos? What kind of clothes is he wearing? Try to remember them so that you can tell the police and warn the other women in your community.</li><li>If there are several people trying to rape you, or if the rapist has a weapon, you can still resist, but it is usually better not to fight back physically.</li><li>Use your best judgement.

Listen to her feelings, help her decide what she needs, and reassure her that she can go on with her life. <br/> <br/> Respect her wishes for privacy and safety. Do not tell anyone else unless she wants you to. <br/> <br/> Go with her to see a health worker, to report the rape to the police, to talk with someone who is trained to listen and support her, to see a lawyer, and to go to court if she wants to do those things.

Family	Sexual Violence	What is rape and sexual assault?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-01.mp3	 Rape and sexual assault both mean sexual contact that a woman does not want. Rape is any time a man puts his penis, finger, or any object into a woman’s vagina, anus, or mouth without her consent. <br/> <br/> Rape is sometimes called sexual ‘assault’ because it is an act of violence, using sex as a weapon. Sexual assault can include rape as well as other kinds of unwanted sexual attention. <br/>
Family	Sexual Violence	What should I do about sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-17.mp3	 STIs are passed more easily with violent sex because the skin in the vagina is often torn. If the man who raped you had an STI, he may have passed it to you. Since you cannot know if he was infected, you should be treated so you can avoid getting an infection and passing it on to others. Take medicines for gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia, and watch for signs of other STIs. Take the medicines whether or not you think you were infected.
Family	Sexual Violence	What should I know about my sexual relations after rape?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-19.mp3	 You can have normal sexual relations again after rape. You will need to wait until your genitals no longer hurt and any tears have healed. For many women, having sex makes them think about the rape. If this happens to you, talk with your partner about why you need to wait.
Family	Sexual Violence	What should I know about rape by a stranger?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-05.mp3	 This is the kind of sexual assault that most people think of when they hear the word ‘rape.’ A woman may be grabbed on the street, or attacked in her home. This kind of rape is very frightening, but it is much less common than rape by someone the woman knows. <br/> <br/> <strong>Gang rape</strong> Gang rape <br/> A woman can be raped by more than one man. Sometimes a man starts raping a woman and other men see it and join in. Or sometimes young men and boys get together and rape a woman to prove their ‘manhood’ to one another. <br/> <br/> <strong>Prison rape</strong> Prison rape <br/> Many women are raped by police or prison guards after they have been arrested. Also, rape is common between male prisoners as a way to establish who has more power. <br/> <br/> <strong>War</strong> War <br/> Soldiers or fighters often use rape to terrorize women and their community, and to make people feel ashamed. Soldiers may gang rape women and girls in front of their families to show the enemy’s power. Women may be held in camps, and forced into prostitution or sexual slavery in order to stay alive, to keep their children safe, or to get food. Rape is a form of torture when it is used in war. <br/> <br/> <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
Family	Sexual Violence	What will happen if I go to the police?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-15.mp3	 In most places rape is a crime. But it may take a long time and be very difficult to prove you were raped. <br/> <br/> Always take someone with you to the police. <br/> <br/> The police will ask you what happened. If you know the rapist, tell them who it is. If you do not, you will need to describe what he looks like. You may have to go with the police to try to find him. You may also be asked to get a medical exam from a legal doctor who works with the police. This is not an exam to help you get well, but to help prove that you were raped. <br/> <br/> In some countries, women have worked with the police to have specially trained female police officers to help victims of rape and violence. <br/> <br/> If the rapist is arrested, you will have to identify him, either in front of the police or in front of a judge in court. If there is a trial, try to find a lawyer who has worked with rape cases before. The lawyer will tell you what to expect and help you prepare for the trial. Always take someone with you.
Family	Sexual Violence	Which kinds of rape and sexual assault do exist?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-03.mp3	 There are many different kinds of sexual assault. But only a few of them are seen by most people as rape. For example, sometimes life events can push a woman into having sex when she does not really want to. This can happen in a marriage. Some married women are made to feel that having sex is their duty, whether they want to or not. Although society does not punish this type of forced sex, it is still wrong. <br/> <br/> For other women, having sex is a way to survive - to get support for their children, to have a place to live or some money, or to keep a job. No matter what the reason is, a woman should not be forced to have sex if she does not want to. <br/> <br/> In any relationship, a woman can choose to accept or refuse a sexual approach. If she refuses, the man then has a choice to either respect her and accept her decision, to try and change her mind, or to force her. Even if the woman knows the man and says “yes,” if saying “no” was not really an option, then it is rape.  <br/> <br/> A woman often finds it harder to ask for help if the man is someone she knows. It is also harder to feel safe if she must see him again.
Family	Sexual Violence	Which women run the highest risk to be raped?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-02.mp3	 Any woman can be raped, but there is an even greater risk if she: <br/> <ul><li> has a disability - if she is in a wheelchair, deaf, blind, or mentally slow.</li><li>is a refugee, migrant, or displaced person, or is living in an area of conflict or war.</li><li>lives on the streets or is homeless.</li><li>is a sex worker (prostitute).</li><li>has been arrested or in prison.</li><li>is being abused by her husband or boyfriend. </li></ul> <li> has a disability - if she is in a wheelchair, deaf, blind, or mentally slow.</li>  has a disability - if she is in a wheelchair, deaf, blind, or mentally slow. <li>is a refugee, migrant, or displaced person, or is living in an area of conflict or war.</li> is a refugee, migrant, or displaced person, or is living in an area of conflict or war. <li>lives on the streets or is homeless.</li> lives on the streets or is homeless. <li>is a sex worker (prostitute).</li> is a sex worker (prostitute). <li>has been arrested or in prison.</li> has been arrested or in prison. <li>is being abused by her husband or boyfriend. </li>
Family	Sexual Violence	Why should I trust my feelings?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-03-07.mp3	 Most women are taught from a very early age to always be polite and to try not to offend anyone. So when someone does something that makes a woman feel uncomfortable, she often has a hard time acting on her feelings. But be careful if you: <br/> <ul><li> have a lasting feeling that something is not right.</li><li>feel afraid, or like you want to leave.</li><li>feel uncomfortable with comments or suggestions the person is making.</li><li>dislike the physical contact he makes.</li></ul> <li> have a lasting feeling that something is not right.</li>  have a lasting feeling that something is not right. <li>feel afraid, or like you want to leave.</li> feel afraid, or like you want to leave. <li>feel uncomfortable with comments or suggestions the person is making.</li> feel uncomfortable with comments or suggestions the person is making. <li>dislike the physical contact he makes.</li> dislike the physical contact he makes. <p>It can be hard to act on these feelings because you may be afraid of what other people will think.

But it is always best to trust your feelings and get out of a situation that feels uncomfortable before anything bad happens.<br/><br/>Trust your feelings.

If you have lost someone to suicide, the pain and confusion may seem overwhelming. Other common reactions to the suicide of a friend or relative are:  <br/> <ul><li> Denial: At first, many people deny what happened. They cannot believe that somebody they believed they knew so well was unhappy enough to end their own life. Hence they try looking for other explanations for the death of the person (such as an accident, a murder, illness etc). They may also simply declare that the notice of his or her death is untrue. This is a normal part of grieving. </li><li>Anger: You may feel a strong feeling of anger towards the person who committed suicide. Maybe you think: ‘How could he/she do this? He/she simply stole away all the times we could have had together and left me. This is so selfish of him/her!’ These thoughts are normal and standard to those who undergo such grief. You have the right to be angry about the choice he/she made to end his/her life, leaving you behind with the legacy of pain and hurt. </li><li>Guilt: You may feel strong guilt, reflected in thoughts such as: ‘It was my fault. If only, I had noticed the signs. I should have seen and done something to help’.

Family	Suicide Prevention	What can I do if I myself feel suicidal?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-08.mp3	 If you have been feeling extremely depressed for a long period of time; feeling as if there is no hope left, no way to deal with all the problems you are facing every day, and nothing left worth living for, then you might think committing suicide is the only solution. However, the truth remains that suicide is a problem, not a solution. Even if you think there is no solution to your problems right now, it does not mean this other solution does not exist and will not appear in the near future. It just means that you cannot see it right now and you have to hold on tight to the reins of life.  <br/> <br/> Think for a minute: Have you always felt like you do right now? The chances are; there were times in your life when you did not mind so much, times when things were not so bad, maybe things were good even. Doesn’t that mean that something in your life changed to make you feel so down? And if it was change that caused so much pain doesn’t it also mean that another change can take the pain away? So be patient, the day will come when things change for the better. Life is a cycle of joy and sorrow, after all. <br/> <br/> IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE:  <ul><li> Do not blame yourself for feeling suicidal. Life’s burdens are just part of life. It’s not your fault.</li><li>Being suicidal doesn’t make you a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed. </li><li>It does not even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now.

Family	Suicide Prevention	What can I do if I someone I know is suicidal?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-15.mp3	 Always take suicidal comments very seriously. When a person says that he or she is thinking about suicide, consider them to be displaying signs of an impending suicide. Get professional help immediately. <br/> <br/> If someone tells you that you need to keep his or her suicidal intentions a secret, never agree. Under no circumstances can you keep a secret that could cause someone's death.

Use common sense to offer words of support. Be as gentle and caring as possible.</li><li>Let the person know that you are deeply concerned. Tell the person that you are concerned, and show them that you are concerned.</li><li>Do not be judgmental. Do not invalidate anything that the person says or feels. Be supportive and caring, not judgmental, but get help immediately. The help can be in the form of family members or friends, as long as they don't play a part in the cause for the suicidal intentions, else an emergency worker or therapist would also be helpful.</li><li>If the person is at a high risk of suicide, do not leave him or her alone, not even for a second. </li><li>After the person has received help and is no longer critically suicidal, help him or her make an appointment with a health worker and/or a therapist.

Family	Suicide Prevention	What other reasons can make a woman want to end her life?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-06.mp3	 Trauma: <br/> Another reason why many women do wish to end their lives, is because they suffered a negative life event and do not know how to deal with it. .Trauma is a happening or happenings that can cause immense physical and/or mental stress to a person, making it difficult to cope with and leaving lasting damage. <br/> <br/> Some of the most common kinds of trauma are violence at home, rape, war, torture, and natural disasters. Other negative life events that can also cause trauma to a woman are the loss and/or death of someone or something important (for example: parental loss, death of husband or a child, loss of jobs or homes), chronic physical illness and development of a disability. Some women feel so overwhelmed by grief, shame or fear in these situations, that to them suicide appears to be the only way out of it. <br/> <br/> Depression or anxiety:  <br/> It does not always take a negative life event or trauma to plunge women into despair. The constant, high level of stress most women experience in their daily life can cause them either depression or anxiety, or even both.  <br/> <br/> Depression is a state of low mood or a feeling of aversion to activity that can affect a person’s behaviour, thoughts, feelings and well-being over a long period of time. Depressive disorder, as it is called by those in the medical field, also causes a ‘heaviness of heart’ or ‘loss of spirit and soul’.  <br/> <br/> Anxiety disorder on the other hand is a feeling of nervousness, worry and general unease over a long period of time. Other terms often used in relation with anxiety disorder are: ‘nerves’, ‘nervous attack’ and ‘mental distresses. When a woman faces a lot of stress every day and for a long time, she may begin to feel overwhelmed and become unable to cope with all the tasks and problems she is facing (e.g.: too much work, lack of money or food, family or marital problems, etc.).  <br/>
Family	Suicide Prevention	What should I know about suicide?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-01.mp3	 The act of intentionally ending one's own life because one does not want to live any more is called suicide. It is estimated that approximately 1 million lives are claimed by suicides every year, globally.  This means that, somewhere in the world a person is committing suicide every 40 seconds. In addition to these numbers, there are at least 20 million failed suicide attempts every year - and numbers are rising. <br/> <br/> Reliable figures are often difficult to find, since many families do not disclose the true nature of a suicide; for fear of harassment by police and/or social stigma.  <br/> <br/> While suicide rates in most first world countries are decreasing, they are increasing alarmingly in the less affluent countries.  <br/> <br/> Possible reasons for these alarming numbers are:  <br/> <ul><li> poverty</li><li>poor education (and therefore lack of job opportunities)</li><li>rapid industrialization (leading to loss of many manual jobs)  </li><li>poor health services (very limited availability of mental health specialists and treatment for problems such as depression or anxiety) </li><li>traditions and lack of understanding (people may be limited by the traditions of a country or society which refuses to accept them as they are)</li></ul> <li> poverty</li>  poverty <li>poor education (and therefore lack of job opportunities)</li> poor education (and therefore lack of job opportunities) <li>rapid industrialization (leading to loss of many manual jobs)  </li> rapid industrialization (leading to loss of many manual jobs)   <li>poor health services (very limited availability of mental health specialists and treatment for problems such as depression or anxiety) </li>

Family	Suicide Prevention	Why do older women wish to commit suicide?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-05.mp3	 A steep increase in suicide rates has observed in the older adults (over 65 years) of many countries.  <br/> <br/> Possible reasons could be:  <br/> <ul><li> Traditional values and norms being quickly disrupted in many countries (due to modernisation). Instead of honouring and appreciating elder people, some societies start to look upon them as useless ballast. Taking care of them becomes an inconvenient chore. In contemplation of this disrespect, many elder people take their lives because they do not want to be a burden any longer to their family and community. </li><li>The forced migration of their loved ones.

Some of them feel so lonely, helpless and depressed that they prefer to take their lives. </li><li>Women often consider old age “the season of losses”. They have to bemoan the deaths of many friends and loved ones.

Family	Suicide Prevention	Why is suicide a major problem for women?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-02.mp3	 Generally, suicide deaths are about three times more common in men than in women. This means: for every female suicide, there are 3 - 4 male suicides. However, in the case of suicide attempts it is the opposite: women attempt suicide three times as frequently as men. 
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why should I communicate with others after the suicide of a loved one?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-18.mp3	 Talking to others can support you, give you more energy and help you understand your feelings.  <br/> <br/> Surround yourself with supportive friends and family members, and talk to them. Know that you are not alone. Always reach out for help when you need it. Get support from people who you love and trust.  <br/> <br/> Join a suicide support group if there are any available in your area. This is a self-help group consisting of people who have all also lost someone through suicide and who meet on a regular basis to talk about their worries and stress. They can understand what you are going through, having gone through it themselves, and will support you. If no such group is available in your area, think about starting one yourself. 
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why should I consider the feelings and responses of those I leave behind if I feel suicidal?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-11.mp3	 How will your family and friends react to the news of your choice to end your life? What impact will it have on them? What impact will it have on your work, business and/or clients? Why should I think of them when I make such a personal decision as to end my life? These may be questions that rise in your mind. <br/> <br/> Make no mistake. Suicide will have a devastating effect on those around you, and the effects will stay with them the rest of their lives. <br/> <br/> Your suicide will probably cause many problems to those you leave behind, especially to your family. In addition to the grief and shock that they will suffer, they will probably be tortured by feelings of guilt and shame for the rest of their lives. They may also have to deal with social stigma or even expulsion from the community you live in.  <br/> <br/> Apart from these problems, there are the problems you yourself are trying to escape from when you contemplate suicide. These issues will not disappear at the point of your death, they will just transfer to become the burden of someone else, causing possible suffering to a loved one or someone close to you,
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why should I look for support if I feel suicidal?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-13.mp3	 Strong social support and strong personal relationships are very important protective factors for our mental health. Those who are suicidal often feel alone. You may have a partner, a family and lots of friends, but you still feel all alone. Just having people around us does not mean we are connected to them. If you are having suicidal thoughts you may think no one will understand or help you. But you are completely wrong.  <br/> <br/> Meeting together with other women can give you more energy, which then helps you cope better with your daily problems. It’s a small world. By talking together, people often begin to realize that many of them suffer from the same kinds of problems. This helps them lessen their burden and also helps them identify root causes of the problem.  <br/> <br/> Besides, it is easier to find solutions to problems by discussing them in a group or with other women. One of the other women might have an idea how to change your situation you have not thought of before - and vice versa.  <br/>
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why should I protect myself after a suicide?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-19.mp3	 Unfortunately, most people do not know much about suicide, and are hesitant to even talk about it. Others may be insensitive or make intentionally hurtful or cruel statements such as: “Your sister killed herself because she was crazy“. In many countries, there is still a very strong stigma associated with suicide. It is important that you protect yourself.  <br/> <br/> Be careful who you tell about the suicide. You would undoubtedly have family members and friends who you trust and can open your soul to about the suicide. But if people come to know about it through rumors and ask about your loved one; if you do not want to talk about it, you can say “I prefer not to talk about that”, or say something similar to politely rebuff them. Do not let anyone push you into talking about something that you are not comfortable with. <br/> <br/> Give yourself time to heal. Stay away from anyone or anything that could cause problems for you. Stay away from people and places that bother you. If anyone says anything offensive, get away from them as quickly as possible. 
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why should I see a doctor, a therapist or a health worker if I feel suicidal?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-10.mp3	 Non-treated depression is one of the main reasons of suicide. Even events that at first sight only bring happiness - like a new baby or getting a job - can become stressful enough to cause a depression. Postnatal depression (or post partum depression), for example, is quite common. Up to one of every 5 women suffer from it after having given birth - most of them without even realizing it.  <br/> <br/> Depression occurs because of an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. It is an illness. Therefore, you should never feel guilty for having a depression. 
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why should I speak to someone if I feel suicidal?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-09.mp3	 People who are contemplating suicide, especially women, are often feeling lonely, isolated, depressed and hopeless at the time. They do not wish to speak to anyone, possibly because they think that no one can help them anyway. The reason could also be that they are too embarrassed or ashamed to talk to anyone about how they are feeling.  <br/> <br/> However, speaking to someone and discussing how you feel will help you a lot. You may look for a person who you confide in to talk to (among your friends, family, neighbors or co-workers) or maybe there is a health worker or a religious leader in your community available you could ask for help. You can also find other women facing similar problems, who are willing to listen and share their thoughts with you.  <br/> <br/> For some women, it is easier to talk to someone who does not know about them or their problems (they feel less embarrassment doing so and also feel that they will get more neutral and unbiased advice). In many countries and regions, there is a suicide prevention hotline available that you can call or chatline you can contact via the internet, if you prefer to talk to someone anonymously and confidentially. You do not have to pay for their services, and you do not even have to tell them your name. These hotlines are non-political and non-sectarian and the people working there do not seek to impose their own beliefs and convictions on you. They are just there to listen to you.  <br/> <br/> You can look up a help hotline number for your country here:  <a class="external free" href="http://www.befrienders.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.befrienders.org/</a> http://www.befrienders.org/ <br/> <br/> Talking to someone will help you not only to identify and understand better the root causes for your problems, but also to find possible solutions. 
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why should I take especially good care of myself after a suicide?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-20.mp3	 The intense emotional pain and turmoil that you feel after having lost someone by suicide can make it hard to function. It is very difficult to move on after a suicide. Healing can be a slow process. Do not try to rush yourself, but be patient and gentle with yourself.  <br/> <br/> If you have difficulty concentrating, become forgetful, or cannot focus; please know that you are undergoing very normal and stressful emotions and do not push yourself too hard. Try to get help with your daily affairs. The smallest of tasks may now seem overwhelming, so ask for help when you need it. If you work, take as much time off as you can.  <br/> <br/> Make sure that you eat a healthy diet and exercise. Doing those two things will help tremendously.  <br/> <br/> Engaging in some forms of relaxation can also be quite helpful. Do some things that you know will relax you. Take a bath. Go for a walk. Listen to some pleasant music. Read some relaxing manga or watch some anime/cartoons.
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why shouldn‘t I act on impulse if I feel suicidal?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-14.mp3	 Many suicides and attempted suicides are done on impulse. In other words, these same people would not have tried to kill themselves just a few days before, or a few days after, or if they had thought their actions through. Think about it, what if your situation changes for the better in the next 24 hours or next week? Wouldn’t you regret not being alive to enjoy the happiness? <br/> <br/> Give yourself some distance. Tell yourself, "I will wait another 24 hours (or even a week) before I do anything". Put some distance between your suicidal thoughts and the actual act, even if it is just 24 hours. <br/> <br/> If the means of committing suicide are present in your house already (e. g. a firearm or poison), get a friend or somebody close to you to help you get rid of them. They should be out of reach (or at least difficult to reach) for you for at least the next 24 hours. You could possibly hand your weapon to a friend and ask him or her not to return it to you for the next 24 hours, no matter what. During this time, do not go near any dangerous places that could tempt you to act on impulse (such as deep hollows, high buildings or bridges, railways etc). 
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why shouldn‘t I blame myself after a suicide?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-21.mp3	 The deep pain of losing a loved one to suicide can bring out many questions and doubts.  <br/> <br/> Know that you are not to blame. Remember that it was not your fault. It was your loved one who made that choice, not you.  <br/> <br/> Guilt is all about intention. Had you known that he/she was going to commit suicide, you would have done what you could to stop it.  <br/> <br/> Accept that you did the best you could with what you knew at the time. And if you slipped up and maybe didn’t take their worries seriously at the time, understand that humans make mistakes. You are human too. It wasn’t intentional.
Family	Suicide Prevention	Why shouldn‘t I use suicide attempts to ‘send a message’ or get revenge?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-09-12.mp3	 Be wary if what is driving you to consider suicide is ‘sending a message’ to others (this is indeed often the case, especially in female suicide attempts). Your actions might be driven from anger, jealousy, hurt or revenge, rather than a true desire to end your life, in which case you are acting impulsively.  <br/> <br/> You may have tried way too many times already, to solve the conflicts or problems that cause you so much pain and suffering, or to change your almost unbearable life circumstances. You may feel that no one around you is really listening or willing to help you. Or maybe, you have suffered a humiliating experience or experiences (for example your partner cheating on you, or your mother-in-law insulting or oppressing you all the time). Either way, now you are looking for a way to pay them back and make them suffer in return.  <br/> <br/> You may be having thoughts such as:  <br/> “Once I almost kill myself/once I die....” <br/> <ul><li> ...They will be sorry for what they did to me.</li><li>...They will finally listen to what I am saying and see that I mean it.</li><li>...They will realize that I desperately need their help and support.</li><li>...They will love me the way I deserve it.</li><li>…They will be wracked by guilt and beg my forgiveness</li><li>...They will change their behaviour.</li></ul> <li> ...They will be sorry for what they did to me.</li>  ...They will be sorry for what they did to me. <li>...They will finally listen to what I am saying and see that I mean it.</li> ...They will finally listen to what I am saying and see that I mean it. <li>...They will realize that I desperately need their help and support.</li> ...They will realize that I desperately need their help and support. <li>...They will love me the way I deserve it.</li> ...They will love me the way I deserve it. <li>…They will be wracked by guilt and beg my forgiveness</li> …They will be wracked by guilt and beg my forgiveness <li>...They will change their behaviour.</li> ...They will change their behaviour. <p>Unfortunately, most of the time (about 99.90% of the time) the expected never happens. Instead, should you survive you will probably have to face even more repression and reproaches because you  ‘dishonoured’  the family by your suicide attempt or are now considered to be mentally insane. And should your suicide attempt by some mischance be successful, you will be dead anyway and therefore unable to see the impact it might have had on other people. You cannot enjoy the possible grief, ruefulness or affection of others any more when you are gone. <br/><br/>IMPORTANT: NEVER use suicide attempts to ‘send a message’ to others.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p> Unfortunately, most of the time (about 99.90% of the time) the expected never happens.

Family	Violence against Women	What are harmful ideas about men hurting women?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-02.mp3	 Here are some of the wrong ideas that people have: <br/> <br/> <strong>„A man can do whatever he wants to his wife.“</strong> „A man can do whatever he wants to his wife.“ <br/> The truth: No man has the right to beat his wife. Nothing a woman does gives a man the right to hurt her, even if he thinks she deserves it - even if she herself thinks she deserves it. <br/> <br/> <strong>„It's just because he drinks...“ </strong> „It's just because he drinks...“  <br/> The truth: Alcohol does not cause violence, but it often makes it worse. Violence is also common in places where people do not drink alcohol. <br/> <br/> <strong>„He wouldn't beat her if he didn't love her so much.“</strong> „He wouldn't beat her if he didn't love her so much.“ <br/> The truth: Beating is not a sign of love.

Family	Violence against Women	What kinds of violence against women do exist?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-04.mp3	 There are many different ways that a man tries to gain power over a woman. Beating is only one of them. But all of them can hurt a woman: <br/> <br/> <strong>Emotional Abuse:</strong> Emotional Abuse:  The man insults the woman, puts her down, or makes her think she is going crazy. <br/> <br/> <strong>Controlling Money:</strong> Controlling Money:  The man tries to keep the woman from getting a job or making her own money. He makes her ask him for any money she needs. Or he may force her to work and then take the money she earns. <br/> <br/> <strong>Sexual Abuse:</strong> Sexual Abuse:  The man makes the woman do sexual things against her will, or physically attacks the sexual parts of her body. He treats her like an object. <br/> <br/> <strong>Blaming Her:</strong> Blaming Her:  The man says that the abuse did not really happen, that it was not serious, or that it was the woman’s fault. <br/> <br/> <strong>Using Children:</strong> Using Children:  The man uses the children to make the woman feel guilty, or to hurt her. <br/> <br/> <strong>Because He Is a 'Man':</strong> Because He Is a 'Man':  The man uses the fact that he is a man as an excuse to treat the woman like a servant.

Family	Violence against Women	What should I be prepared for if I leave?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-17.mp3	 If you decide to leave, you will need to be prepared for some of the new difficulties you will face: <br/> <br/> <strong>Safety</strong> Safety <br/> The most dangerous time for a woman is after she leaves. The man has lost control over her and will usually do anything to get it back. He may even try to follow through on his threat to kill her. She must make sure she is staying in a safe place that he does not know about or where she is protected. She should not tell anyone where she is staying. He may be able to force them to tell him where she is. <br/> <br/> <strong>Surviving on your own </strong> Surviving on your own  <br/> You need to find a way to support yourself and your children.

Family	Violence against Women	What should I know about the cycle of violence?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-08.mp3	 The first violent attack often seems like an isolated event. But in many cases, after the violence first happens the following pattern, or cycle, develops: <br/> <br/> Violence happens: hitting, slapping, kicking, choking, use of objects or weapons, sexual abuse, verbal threats and abuse. <br/> <br/> A calm period follows the violence: The man may deny the violence, say he is sorry, or promise it will never happen again. <br/> <br/> Then slowly tension builds again: anger, arguing, blaming, verbal abuse. <br/> <br/> Violence happens again .... <br/> <br/> As the violence goes on, the calm period gets shorter and shorter for many couples. As the woman’s will is broken, the man’s control over her becomes so complete that it is no longer necessary for him to make promises that things will get better.
Family	Violence against Women	What should I know about warning signs regarding violence?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-05.mp3	 When an abusive relationship becomes violent, it is much harder to leave. The longer a woman stays, the more control the man has over her, and the less faith she may have in herself. Some men are more likely to become violent than others. There are certain signs that may mean a man will become violent. If you see these signs, and have a way to get out of the relationship, think carefully.
Family	Violence against Women	Which warning signs should I look for?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-06.mp3	 Ask yourself these questions: <br/> <br/> Does he act jealous when you see other people, or accuse you of lying to him? If you find you change your behavior to keep him from acting jealous, then he is controlling you. <br/> <br/> Does he try to keep you from seeing your friends and family, or from doing things on your own? It does not matter what reason he uses. He is trying to keep you from having their support. It will be easier for him to abuse you if you have nowhere else to go. <br/> <br/> Does he insult you or make fun of you in front of other people? You may start to believe what he says. This can make you feel as though you deserve to be treated badly. <br/> <br/> What does he do when he gets angry? Does he break or throw things? Has he ever physically hurt you or threatened to hurt you? Has he ever hit another woman? All of these things show that he has trouble controlling the way he acts. <br/> <br/> Does he feel insulted by people with authority, such as his teachers, bosses, or his father? He may feel he has no power. This can make him try to gain power over other people in other areas of his life by using violence. <br/> <br/> Does he claim that alcohol, drugs, or stress are the reasons he acts the way he does? If he puts the blame on something else, he may say things will get better if he gets a new job, moves to a new town, or stops using drugs or alcohol.
Family	Violence against Women	Which women are more likely to be abused?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-07.mp3	 In many couples, the man becomes more violent for the first time when the woman is pregnant. He may feel as though he is losing control because he cannot control the changes in her body. He may feel angry because she is paying more attention to the baby and less to him, or because she may not want to have sex with him. Also, many couples feel extra worried about money when they are expecting a new baby.

Family	Violence against Women	Why Does a Man Hurt a Woman?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-03.mp3	 A man may offer many excuses for hurting a woman - that he was drunk, that he lost control, or that she ‘deserved it’. But a man chooses to use violence because it is a way he can get what he needs or what he feels is rightfully his as a man. <br/> <br/> When a man does not feel that he has power over his own life, he may use violence to try and control another person’s life. It is natural for someone to want to control his or her own life in normal ways, but it is wrong to try and control someone else’s life, especially with violence.  <br/> <br/> Here are some of the reasons why some men hurt women: <br/> <br/> <strong>Violence works</strong> Violence works <br/> It offers the man a quick end to a disagreement without having to talk about the real problem or find a real solution. <br/> A man may find the fight exciting, and have lots of energy afterward. He may want to have these feelings again. <br/> If a man uses violence, he ‘wins’ and gets his way. The victim is likely to give him his way again the next time to avoid being hurt. This gives the man even more power. Violent or abusive relationships often happen when one person has more power over the other. <br/> <br/> <strong>The man has a wrong idea about what it means to be a man.</strong> The man has a wrong idea about what it means to be a man. <br/> If a man believes that to be a man, he must control what a woman does, he may feel it is OK to hurt her. <br/> Some men think that they have a ‘right’ to certain things -  to a ‘good’ wife, to sons, to making all the decisions in the family - just because they are men. Violent or abusive relationships often happen when one person has more power over the other. <br/> <br/> <strong>The man feels that the woman belongs to him, or that he needs her.</strong> The man feels that the woman belongs to him, or that he needs her. <br/> If the woman is ‘strong’, the man may feel afraid that he will lose her, or that she does not need him. He will take steps to make her more dependent on him. <br/> If men think of women and girls as their property  -  something they own  -  they are more likely to feel as though it is their right to treat them however they want. <br/> <br/> <strong>He does not know any other way to be.</strong> He does not know any other way to be. <br/> If a man has seen his father or other people in his life react with violence when life is difficult and stressful, then he may have never learned any other way to behave. 
Family	Violence against Women	Why is violence against women such a problem?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-01-01.mp3	 Every day, women are slapped, kicked, beaten, humiliated, threatened, sexually abused, and even murdered by their partners.

Drip irrigation systems use 30 to 50 percent less water than conventional watering methods, including most sprinklers.</li><li>A proper irrigation system supplies small but constant quantities of water, which creates ideal growing conditions for most plants. More efficient watering means less weed growth. The plants maximize water use since the water is delivered at the base of the plants. This leads to improved seed germination, increased crop yields and fewer weeds since there is only little water available for them.</li><li>Since water is applied locally, leaching is reduced, fertilizer or nutrient loss minimized. This means that fertilizers can be used with high efficiency, reducing waste.</li><li>Operation costs are reduced.</li><li>Soil infiltration capacity is increased.</li><li>Fertilizers and ground water is not mixed.</li></ul> <li> Drip irrigation is the most efficient method of irrigating because the emitter delivers water directly to the plants minimizing wastage.

Work	Drip Irrigation	What is drip irrigation and why is it important?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-03-02-01.mp3	 Drip irrigation is a climate smart irrigation system that delivers water directly to the plant roots. <br/> <br/> In most parts of the world, irrigation remains a necessity in crop production. Even with the rainfall, some crops still need irrigation especially in the arid and semi-arid regions. Intense heat and dry climatic conditions can be a big challenge for proper crop growth and development. As much as irrigation is crucial, using too much water can cause problems such as leaching nutrients, reduced root growth, water-logging, salt build up on the root zone as well as reduction of plant quality and yield.

Work	Safety at Work	How can cooking fires and smoke damage my health?	https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-03-01-01.mp3	 Most women spend many hours a day preparing food. This puts them at risk for health problems caused by cooking fires and smoke. <br/> <br/> Kerosene and other liquid and gas fuels can cause explosions, fires, and burns. <br/> <br/> Women who cook with fuels that produce a lot of smoke  -  such as wood, coal, animal dung, or crop remains  -  often have health problems. These fuels cause more problems when they are burned indoors where the smoke does not move out quickly. And if the fuel has chemicals in it  -  such as pesticides or fertilizers in the crop remains  -  the smoke is even more harmful. <br/> <br/> Breathing smoke from cooking fires can cause chronic coughs, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, lung infections, and lung disease. Breathing coal smoke can also cause cancer in the lungs, mouth, and throat. <br/> <br/> Pregnant women who breathe cooking smoke can suffer from dizziness, weakness, nausea, and headaches. And because a woman’s body is less able to fight infection when she is pregnant, she is even more likely to get the lung problems mentioned above. Smoke can also make her baby grow more slowly, weigh less at birth, or be born too early.

Cut a 4-inch round hole in the middle of the lid for the chimney. Cut another 4-inch round hole in the lower front side of the can, about 1 inch up from the bottom of the can, for the burning chamber. The holes you cut should fit around your stove pipe or tin cans.<br/><br/>Place the stove pipe with the elbow inside the can so that one end sticks out of the front of the can. Make 2 parallel cuts ½ inch apart at the long end of the pipe and bend the section back to create a lip. This way the pipe will not slip back into the can. The long section of this pipe will be the burning chamber (where the fuel burns).
